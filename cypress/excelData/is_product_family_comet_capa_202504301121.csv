 Impacted site: GB10008 (University College Hospital London, UCLH) 
 Per the protocol and general GCP principles, procedures outlined in the protocol and its schedule of assessment should be completed, documented, and reported by the site in the site’s source notes (the patient medical notes / health record) and recorded in the electronic Case Record Form (eCRF i.e. Sponsor’s system is RAVE). Additionally, all adverse events (AEs) experienced by participating patients should be assessed, documented and recorded by the site in RAVE in a timely manner. On an ongoing basis the Sponsor’s site manager (SM) should monitor site adherence to these principles and document any issues encountered. 
 SM Sophia Lau (SL) completed a remote monitoring visit (MV) on 07 March 2024. During the course of her monitoring she noted incomplete adherence by the site to protocol procedural requirements and AE and associated conmed reporting. Additionally, there was an apparent failure to detect these issues historically by past SMs. The issues can be grouped into two general categories:    1.     Inaccurate reporting of AEs and associated conmeds by site and a failure of monitoring to detect. ·        Issue-1A: AEs and conmeds had discrepancies between the source and RAVE. ·        Issue-1B: Not all AEs and conmeds referenced in the source were entered into RAVE. 
 It is important to note that the following information is based upon initial monitoring and information provided by the site. The number of AEs and conmeds for the discrepancies detailed below need to be verified by the SM during monitoring.   a.      For patient 330512 from May 2023 – 21 February 2024 ·        9 AEs documented in the source notes (EPIC EHR) but had not been recorded in the EPIC AE log. ·        10 AEs documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE ·        9 AEs documented in the EPIC AE log but not recorded in RAVE ·        9 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in the EPIC Medication log ·        13 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE   b.      For patient 330829 from October 2022 – 06 March 2024 ·        1 potential SAE (to be reviewed and confirmed by the investigator) documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE  ·        25 AEs documented in the source notes but not recorded in the EPIC AE log  ·        29 AEs documented in the source notes but not recorded into the RAVE  ·        7 AEs documented in the EPIC AE log but not documented in RAVE ·        3 AEs documented in RAVE but not recorded in the EPIC AE log  ·        2 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in the EPIC Medication log ·        39 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE  ·        2 conmeds documented in the EPIC Medication log but not recorded in RAVE  ·        1 conmed documented in the EPIC research study tab but not recorded in RAVE    c.      For patient 330854 from November 2022 – 28 February 2024: ·        7 AEs documented in the source notes but not recorded in the EPIC AE log ·        9 AEs documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE ·        12 AE documented in the EPIC AE log but not recorded in RAVE ·        7 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in the EPIC Medication log ·        17 conmeds documented in the source notes but not recorded in RAVE ·        1 conmed documented in the EPIC Medication log but not recorded in RAVE   2.     Incomplete adherence to protocol procedural requirements by site and a failure of monitoring to detect. ·        Issue-2A: Investigators are required to indicate whether or not out of range lab results are clinically significant. This was inconsistently completed in the notes for specific labs. ·        Issue-2B: The protocol requires that any medical procedure a patient received beyond the scope of the protocol as part of standard of care should be reported in the eCRF (RAVE). Such procedures for the patients indicated below were not reported. ·        Issue-2C: Patient reported outcomes (PRO) are required to be completed and answers submitted to the Sponsor. The site completed PROs for the patients below but failed to submit. It is important to note that the following information is based upon initial monitoring and information provided by the site. The number of study procedures not recorded in RAVE and the number of lab reports missing documented review for clinical significance (i.e. clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS)) needs to be verified by the SM during monitoring.

 As part of the immediate actions addressed under NC-009500, the additional tests across QC laboratories which had already been performed for these CNTO9541 samples were evaluated to identify which reference material had been used during analysis. It was identified that the incorrect Gen 1 RM was used for cSDS R, cSDS NR and Dot Blot analyses of CNTO9541 samples 240489036 - 563476 - 3177170 & 240489478 - 563476 - 3177171. Dot Blot uses all three CNTO4424, CNTO4005 and CNTO9541 reference materials in its analysis. The incorrect CNTO4424, CNTO4005 and CNTO9541 reference materials had been used in the analysis of CNTO9541 samples 240489036 - 563476 - 3177170 & 240489478 - 563476 - 3177171. This widened the scope of NC-009500 to assess if the correct reference materials had been used for all CNTO4424, CNTO4005 and CNTO9541 assays performed since 14Dec2023. The Gen 2 intermediate reference materials for CNTO4005 and CNTO9541 were only available as of 14Dec2023, all CNTO4424, CNTO4005 and CNTO9541 assays performed before 14Dec2023 are not in scope of NC-009500.

The following major observations were raised during the visit:    Observation-1: ICF process not conducted according to GCP for 1/1 patient at site    Consenting process and discussion for all versions of consents are not documented on the source notes.  Patient is not fluent in English but translated forms and/or interpreter were not used per local HREC and RGO requirements. Site only confirmed on 22-Mar-2024 that patient has basic English understanding and that moving forward, interpreter services will be used. During this CMV, it was also noted that there was inconsistency with the interpreter services that were provided.  22-Mar-2024/C36D15 – Mandarin interpreter  2-Apr-2024/C37D1 – Mandarin phone interpreter  16-Apr-2024/C37D15 – Cantonese interpreter  29-Apr-2024/C38D1 – Cantonese interpreter  Reported as major issue in CTMS that requires immediate escalation to central study team.    Observation-2: Source documents incomplete/inconsistent/not available to support CRF data for 1/1patient at site.  Paper AE and ConMed logs used by site in early stages of the study were missing.  Evaluation of response (RECIST) were missing. However, when asked how they were completing disease evaluations, site confirmed they have a patient runner file which includes a RECIST tracker from study start to current, patient IWRS transactions, and local lab results which have been signed by the investigators.SM wasn't aware this patient runner file existed. Hence, the RECIST documentations have not been reviewed for this patient prior to this CMV.  Investigation Product (IP) returns and compliance were not consistently documented in the Electronic Medical Record (EMR). For example, C30D1 listed 'Study Drug Name', 'Bottle Returned (Lot ID)', 'Dose Missed', and 'Reason for Missed Dose'. However, the other visits may or may not have these information.  Adverse Event (AE) RASH- SKIN, SCALP, SCAB (event date 18-Sep-2023) - AE toxicity grade in EMR is '2-3' whilst in EDC, it is '3'. No clarification on AE toxicity grade was provided in source.  AE DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION (event date 28-Mar-2024) - AE toxicity grade in EMR is '2' whilst in EDC, it is '1'. No clarification on AE toxicity grade was provided in source.  Patient was admitted to the emergency department on 23-Apr-2024. However, there was no clarification in investigator notes that this was not considered an SAE.  C30D1 EMR notes:  SC listed Dapsone 50mg as ConMed for RASH & PARONYCHIA, taken from1-Apr-2022 to 12-Aug2022. However, the Sub-I noted there was an ‘increased dose of dapsone to 50mg daily continuously'.  SC listed Betamethasone cream (0.02%) as ConMed for PROPHYLAXIS -RASH, applied from 29-Jun-2021 to 28-Feb-2022. However, it is unclear if this is still currently being applied by the patient per the prescription IP label on C38. Concentration on the prescription label is 0.2% which is also inconsistent with RAVE and EMR.  Coles and Zouki vouchers were being provided to the patient. However, there was no HREC and RGO approval/correspondence are available regarding this.  Site used a screening checklist. However, it was noted that footer on the medical and surgical history page refers to another J&J study. It was also observed that the inclusion criterion for the patient, 'Any toxicities from prior anticancer therapy must have resolved to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)Grade 1 or baseline level' was answered 'N/A' by the investigator. However, there were no supporting records and/or comment that could verify this. LTM confirmed post-CMV that SRP approval was requested from previous SM and this has now been filed in vTMF. Furthermore, previous SM confirmed patient didn’t have prior anti-cancer therapy so didn't have any non-resolved toxicities.  Site scans paper source documents i.e., original laboratory results, IWRS and Disease Evaluation reports to ARIA (sites EMR). However, their process is unclear for generating certified copies of source documents. Cross-check of eSource documents as required per Monitoring Guidelines has not been done yet for this site.  
 Observation-3: Lab procedure not followed incurring in repetitive samples not done or unable to be analysed for 1/1 patient at site     Site missed consecutive ddPCR samples for disease evaluation (DE) visits for the patient on 4-May-2023, 30-June-2023, 23-Aug-2023, 19-Oct-2023, and 18-Jan-2024. This was previously entered as major issue in CTMS and site retraining was completed. However, on 26-Mar-2024, site conducted a DE visit and ddPCR was not collected despite their training. ",NC-011909,Internal,Nicole-Sohail Young,Nicole-Sohail Young,Complete,Verification,"2024-06-13 09:55:19.0","2025-04-30 00:00:00.0",,,,,,

 The team implemented a protocol clarification communication on 01Feb2023 regarding collection of lipase and amylase samples. The site was activated on 08Mar2023 but did not receive the communication letter from the clinical team on 19Jun2023. During review of the investigator site file, the approval for the protocol clarification communication was not present. The auditor requested the approval letter from the clinical team, and it was noted that the protocol clarification had not been submitted to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for approval prior to the site implementing the new laboratory sample collection. The sample collection was added to the approved 19Oct2023 protocol version, however from June 2023 to October 2023, the site was collecting the samples without IRB approval. The clinical team submitted the approval on 16Apr2024. The clinical team received approval on 19Apr2024 and filed documentation in the Trial Master File.

This meant they did not undergo required review by REC/HRA. When submitted as a NSA, the documents are not reviewed by the REC and the applicant receives an automated confirmation of receipt by the HRA on submission. The above ICFs should have been submitted as substantial amendments and undergone review by the ethics committee.    Per TV-WI-07599 GBR – Management of Clinical Trial Amendments and in accordance with The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, UK (SI 2004/1031) Regulation 24 these documents should have been submitted as substantial amendments requiring REC/HRA review. These ICFs were implemented at two UK sites where subjects were consented/re-consented to ICFs which had not been reviewed by REC/HRA.    The HRA is not the UK licensing authority. The UK licensing authority is the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).     The 61186372NSC1003 was intended to have three Parts and the Master ICF was written to cover all parts:   Part 1 to evaluate the feasibility of SC administration of Low Concentration amivantamab using the available IV formulation (50 mg/mL) at the RP2D level for IV administration either alone or admixed and delivered with rHuPH20.   Part 2 to evaluate a High Concentration (160 mg/mL) formulation of amivantamab either alone or co-formulated with rHuPH20. The first dose level in Part 2 will be the RP2D level for IV administration and additional dose levels will be evaluated to select an appropriate SC dose, dosing regimen, and formulation for further clinical development.   Part 3 to evaluate the safety and PK of SC amivantamab (160 mg/mL) administered at the RP2D determined from Part 2 in combination with lazertinib 240 mg QD oral intake.  However, on 30-Sep-2022, it was decided by the central team that Part 3 (amivantamab combined with lazertinib) would no longer go ahead in this study.

The above ICFs should have been submitted as substantial amendments and undergone review by the ethics committee.  The current version of ICF is v11.0 dated 05Jan2024.     Ellice Marwood, GCOUK ED&CP Trial Manager identified this issue on 01-May-2024 during local quality review of country-level study documents filed in Veeva Vault Trial Master File (VTMF) review.     The changes made to these ICFs constitute ‘Significant Changes’ because they are likely to affect the safety or physical or mental integrity of the participations and the risk/benefit assessment and per The Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, UK Statutory Instruments, Regulation 24 of SI 2004/1031, Sponsors are required to submit these as a Substantial Amendment to the REC and HRA, for review and receive favourable opinion from the REC and HRA approval before implementation at sites (J&J TV-WI-07599 GBR – Management of Clinical Trial Amendments) (see attachment for full details on all ICF updates and submissions in the UK for the 61186372NSC1003 study in evidence 06)    The updated ICF V5.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 were implemented at sites and patients consented / re-consented with information that had not been given favourable opinion by the REC and approval by the HRA where the updated ICF had been only notified to the REC and HRA.    Two UK sites are participating in this study that have implemented these ICFs; GB10001 (The Christie) and GB10002 (The Royal Marsden). To date (22May2024), GB10001 has enrolled 16 patients and GB10002 has enrolled 32. The 61186372NSC1003 study is not anticipated to enroll any further patients. The updates to the ICFs were not related to study eligibility criteria, therefore, there has been no impact on inclusion or exclusion criteria for subjects enrolled to date.    As mentioned above, Lazertinib was only proposed to be given in Part 3 of the study, but it was decided on 30-Sep-2022, Part 3 would not go ahead in this study, therefore no patients in this study have received Lazertinib.    To note that the corresponding updated IBs (as referenced in the bullets above and in the evidence 06) that were deemed a substantial amendment had been submitted and approved by the UK HA, the MHRA.    During the meeting with the GTLs on 21-May-2024, it was confirmed that there is no impact on patient safety or on the study integrity, this has been confirmed in an email from Donna Zemlickis (GTL).

 Several issues that might affect the Integrity of Data were identified. Site staff was not certifying copies from Electronic Medical Records and some procedures or requested information weren´t documented in a timely manner 
 1.According to the Guideline on computerized systems and electronic data in clinical trials published by the European Medicines Agency on 09 March 2023, data source should be the original first generation/capture of the observation, but certified copies can replace original data. The result of the copy process should be verified either automatically by a validated process or manually to ensure that the same information is present as in the original. However, this site was using electronic Medical Records and providing Site Manager with printouts for monitoring purposes, but these printouts were not being certified and this issue had not been escalated by the Site Manager. 
 2.Regarding to Physical Examination, the protocol states that a symptom-directed physical examination will be conducted at screening and as clinically indicated from Cycle 1 Day 1 onward. It also states that physical examination of extremities and evaluation of respiratory status should be performed, particularly during the first 4 months of assigned therapy. For three (3) out of three (3) patients reviewed (221049, 226011, 222066), there was not any evidence in the source documents indicating that required physical examinations had been conducted in Screening or Cycle 1 Day 1. 
 3.For three (3) out of three (3) male participants (21049, 226011, 222066), Investigators weren´t documenting if the patients were using contraceptive methods and if they had been approved by the Investigator. The Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) states: ""You should discuss the type of contraceptive method you and your partner use with the study doctor before starting the study. The study doctor must approve the methods you use before you can participate in the study"". 
 4.Some Adverse Events were not properly documented by the Investigators for one (1) out of five (5) reviewed patients. Examples included but not limited to: Patient 221049: Subinvestigator documented ""rounded ulcer at the back of the palate"", but she didn´t document the grade or IP relationship. Patient 221049: Subinvestigator documented ""habitual haemorrhoids with bleeding with bowel movements"", but she didn´t document grade or IP relationship. Patient 221049: Subinvestigator documented ""petechial rash on the forearms"", but she didn´t document grade or IP relationship 5.The two patients who had suffered Serious Adverse Events (222066 and 222026) were reviewed and Site Manager (SM) was not being provided with the correct source documents to verify information related to possible adverse events occurring during the admission or concomitant medications administered during the patients admission. Since the SM was being provided only with the discharge report and not with the daily medical notes recorded during the admission, she wasn´t being able to detect possible adverse event occurring during the admission. The auditor was discussing about this with the Study Coordinators during the audit, and they confirmed that they don´t check the daily notes for data entry purposes either and investigators are not evaluating these adverse events occurring during the patient admission. There is a similar scenario regarding to the concomitant medication administered during the patients admission. Site Staff is providing SM with prescribed medications but not with the list of the medications hat have been really administered. The administered medication list is not being reviewed by Study Coordinators for data entry purposes either. During the audit, the diary notes related to the patient 222026 admission were provided and some examples were identified indicating that the information entered on eCRF not always was accurate because Study Coordinators or SM are not reviewing the correct source documents for data entry and Source Data Verification purposes: 
 The patient had suffered hypotension and diarrhea during the admission and these events hadn´t been evaluated by investigators or entered on eCRF. The nurses had comented ""Analgesics no needed"" and the end date of the medication hadn´t been entered accordingly. Since the person in charge of data entry is not reviewing the daily notes, and he wasn´t able to identify adverse events occurring during the SAE, medications such as folic acid, calciferol, calcium carbonate and cholecarciferol were linked to the SAE (Respiratory Infection). 6.Site Staff was providing the patients with a patient diary created by them and the patients document information related to the time when they have taken Lazertinib every day. One of the patients, patient 226011, had documented, moreover, information related to adverse events suffered or concomitant medications taken during the cycle. There wasn´t any evidence in the source documents indicating that the Information related to the adverse events had been evaluated by the Investigator or if they had confirmed the concomitant medications reported by the patient. Study Coordinator confirmed that they are not reviewing this information for data entry purposes. 
 7. Inconsistencies between information recorded in source documents and data entered on eCRF were detected for three (3) out of three (3) patients reviewed. Examples included but not limited to: Patient 221049: On 04Apr2023, the investigator documents rash in face, scalp, cervical and sternal region and on the back. However, only the Rash in face was entered on eCRF. Patient 222026: Mycostatin was prescribed on 03Nov2023 to treat mucositis but it wasn´t entered on eCRF. Patient 222066: On 06Feb2023, the investigator documents that the patient is taking Lorazepam, but this drug has not been entered on eCRF. Moreover, for one (1) out of three (3) patients reviewed (226011, 221049, 222066) Data Entry has entered on eCRF some data that had not been previously documented by investigators. 
 Examples included but not limited to: 
 Patient 221049: investigators haven´t documented the grade of rounded ulcer at the back of the palate in the source document but the data has been entered on eCRF. Patient 221049: investigators haven´t documented the grade of habitual hemorrhoids with bleeding with bowel movements in the source document but the data has been entered on eCRF. References:

Prior to CNTO4424 20kg IV FB batch #367544 all activities associated with pooling, reduction, UFDF1 and Low pH VIN inactivation of MM#309491 were completed in P01.64 (DSP1 Pre-Viral Suite). For all batches post and including PO#367544 these steps were moved to P01.105 (DSP1 Pre-Viral Decoupling Suite). This update was completed as per CC2270784 , Update to the CNTO4424 20kG IV Process in DSP1.   One of the changes captured within CC2270784 was that the UFDF1 material would be recovered directly into the Filtered FAE SUM removing the requirement for the FAE SUM. The use of the FAE SUM was deemed a redundant step and updating the process aligned the practice with the 30kg and 65kg CNTO4424 processes. Reference Attachment 03 of NC-013892 for process flow pre and post change.   Prior to the implementation of this change, Stage Code 100, Bioburden testing for the FAE Intermediate (Pre-filtration), was taken from the FAE SUM post recovery.    As this SUM is no longer used for processing the sample is now taken from the FAE process stream pre-filtration. This aligns with filling section 3.2.S.2.4, Table 3, which outlines that, for Stage 8, Bioburden is taken from the FAE Intermediate (Pre-filtration). Reference Attachment 01 of NC-013892.   As per section 3.3 (Manufacturing Process) of both the EU and BLA filling  3.2.S.2.2, a detailed description is given to the actual sample point for the FAE pre-filtration sample. This is detailed as follows:   The concentrated retentate is recirculated to recover product and collected in a CX5-14 SUM vessel. The system is flushed using diafiltration buffer to recover remaining product. The buffer flush is then pooled with the concentrated product in the SUM. The product is mixed to ensure homogeneity and sampled for IPC testing for bioburden.""   This detailed description does not align with the current sampling description. The description details that the product is recovered into an intermediate SUM along with the buffer flush, mixed and sampled for Stage Code 100. However, as this intermediate SUM has been removed from the process it is no longer possible to sample at this point. The actual manufacturing sample location is the FAE material pre-filtration which is taken from the retentate vessel.   Additionally, this misalignment is also present in the product specific DPFD (TV-TEC-160829 “Technology Transfer Downstream Process Stages 6-14 for the Manufacturing of CNTO4424 (JNJ-61186372) at Janssen Sciences Ireland (JSI) UC” Version 15.0) and the product specific BOT (TV-SOP-41149 “Downstream Bill of Testing for JNJ-61186372 (CNTO4424 Gen1 Formulated Bulk 20Kg IV Process” Version 19.0).   The discrepancy was first identified following a query by the Japanese Local Operating Company (LOC) in preparation for the Amivantamab Japansese submission and communicated to JSI on the 04JUN24. The discrepancy was brought to technical launch integrator (BML) where it was identified on the 10Jun24 that investigation was needed to further investigate the discrepancy.",NC-013892,Internal,Jose Garcia,Jose Garcia,Complete,Verification,"2024-07-02 11:18:08.0","2024-12-17 00:00:00.0",,,"000000000000309491; 000000000000310927",CNTO 4424 Formulated Bulk 20Kg; CNTO4424 30KG FB,N/A; N/A,

 During review of the investigator site file (ISF) and site staff training records, there was insufficient documentation to confirm that the delegated site staff was trained on key study documentation such as 61186372NSC2002 Protocol, version Amendment 3.0 and 4.0 and Investigational Product Preparation and Administration Instructions for JNJ-61186372 for Manual Subcutaneous Administration (IPPI). 
 The study coordinator explained that the site follows the process below for continual training. 1. The protocol amendment or safety update is emailed to all study team members by the primary study coordinator with a summary of the changes. 2. The summary of changes is presented at the weekly clinical research team meetings. 3. Upon IRB approval, all updated documents are posted to the site’s protocol library to ensure only the most recent version is used and referenced. Study team members include every co-investigator, research nurse, study coordinator, and service core member, who is current on the study delegation of authority log. 
 The study coordinator also provided the site’s SOP for staff research training and documentation.   
 As an example, the study coordinator provided an email sent to the study team on 08-Aug-2023 regarding protocol amendment 3 and the summary of changes for training purposes. In the email, however, it was highlighted that no response is required. The email served as documentation that training was completed. 
 There was no process at the site where recipients responded to the email for training purposes and there was no other acknowledgement or tracking to confirm all study team members received and read the emails and the date they read the emails. Within the site policy and SOP, there was also no information how training date was confirmed. For the example above, for protocol amendment 3, the training completion date was recorded as the date the email was sent to the study team (08-Aug-2023), however, there was no confirmation that the team opened the email on that day. Regarding the weekly clinical research team meetings, it was not observed if an attendance sheet is maintained and if there was tracking for who was present when summary of changes were presented. 
 This training issue was not previously identified by the site manager.

 The Monitoring guideline stated that the Source Document Identification and Agreement Form should include ‘Other data types’ such as NSCLC diagnosis information, EGFR mutation, Infusion-related reaction (IRR), and discussions with the medical monitor must be included.  
 The above-required information had not been included for all SDIA versions (dated 06Sep2023 and 20May2024) developed for this site. 
 3-2. The source documentation for vital signs (i.e. Temperature, pulse/heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, blood pressure) defined on SDIA form dated 20May2024 was incorrect.  
 The study coordinator (SC) explained that the vital sign worksheet was initially generated by typing in the computer during the infusion, and then printed out after the infusion was completed. The type-written paper would be handed to investigator for entry into EMR for visits after C1D2. However, the SDIA form indicated that “primary source for vital signs was EMR and the worksheet was used as a copy of data for rearrangement of clinical data during infusion”. 
 In addition, as there were different ways of vital signs collection (direct entry from vital sign machines and direct EMR entry by ward nurses during C1D1 and C1D2) for different visits, the accuracy of the defined source in the SDIA form for vital signs could not be confirmed.

Specifically, 
 A. While observing the aseptic setup of the filling line LPF2 for amivantamab SC drug product filling batches ID PIS46 and PIS3V on September 17, 2024, the following deficiencies were observed: 
 a. Indirect product contact parts such as stopper bowl, stopper chute, and stoppering parts were not removed and sterilized prior to each use. 
 b. Operators were observed unwrapping items (e.g., filling needles, filling needles holder, filling pump tubing) and installing these sterilized parts with isolator intervention gloves. In addition, filling needles were installed at the beginning and exposed while other filling and dosing tubing being installed. 
 c. Operators were initially holding the drug product dosing pump tubing with one isolator intervention glove near the opening of the tube for an extended period of time while untangling the remaining tubing inside the stericlean bag wrapping, then passing the tube with the open end over to the opposite side of the isolator to another operator for connecting. The tip of the tubing was observed coming into close to contact with other surfaces inside the isolator. Operators were also observed opening the second package of tubing and wrapping the opening of the tubing with previously used stericlean bag material while untangling the remaining portion inside the bag. 
 B. During the aseptic filling of amivantamab SC batches ID PIS46 and PIS3V on September 18, 2024, the formation of drug products droplets at the fill needle tips was observed when the filling needles were at the idling position during the active air sampling. In addition, several of the needles (more often with needle tip #6) showed noticeable movement of droplets in and out of the tip as the filling needle module was moving vertically during the starting up of the machine and weight checking of the vials.

The eLIMS configuration change should not impact the original reported data when adding values for peak 7 in eLIMS.

 The following activities were decided and executed. 
 M&F completed pump head change-out. External clean done on SK425 (eLOG ID 76375673) Existing recipe on SK425 was aborted and AWFI flush was completed (membranes bypassed). A new recipe was loaded through the MBR for NWP (OP_UFDF_PR_NEW_MEM_PROC_SETUP), result = 68% (Specification >=60%). Pre use clean recipe (OP_UFDF_PR_PROC_SETUP) was then loaded through the MBR. AWFI Flush, Integrity Test (passed) and 1M NaOH recirculation completed Pump speed, TMP and flow rates were trended on this batch against previous batches, no deviation from trends. The skid dirty hold time is 29Hrs 49mins. Skid clean started after approx.16Hrs. (TV-SOP-41863 version 43.0) AWFI flush post 1M NaOH recirculation, IPT and Equil. New Equil sample labels printed (241913368 & 241913372). Setup for processing and load new processing recipe through the MBR (OP_UFDF_PR_PROCESSING). Agitator and TCM to be turned on 15 minutes prior to restarting the process. Ad-hoc Bioburden sample (241913423) to be taken. Automation required to move the recipe to the Diafiltration Recirculation step and change the time from 200 to 105 Mins. NRSP TV-TEC-239320 updated to reflect new sampling strategy due to this process pause.   Diafiltration recirculation hold started at 11:59:37 on 27 October 2024 and was held at 13:15:52 due to PU-001 failure. This was verified on Pi Batch View by MPS RSM. Therefore 1hr 16mins 15secs elapsed. 4575seconds elapsed. On 28 Oct 2024 this recirculation was restarted and the parameter for recirculation time was changed to 6300s as per ESS059868. Therefore 10875 seconds were completed.

 The following issues were noted: 1. For 3 out of 3 (100%) non-interventional studies (NIS) reviewed, the protocol, and the Investigator Safety Training (IST) material did not include off-label and suspected transmission of an infectious agent as required in TV-SOP-20172, Reporting of Adverse Events (AE), special situation (SS), Complaints and Pregnancies in Non-Interventional Studies. This did not ensure that these 2 types of special situation reports would be identified by site personnel and would be reported to JJIM. 1.1. 61186372LUC4005, post-authorization observational study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Rybrevant (amivantamab) in Korea, study start date 13-Oct-2022, status: In Progress 1.2. 54135419TRD4007, Observational study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of Spravato (esketamine) in Korea, study start date 09-Dec-2020, status: In Progress  1.3. 54767414MMY4005, A multicenter, prospective, observational study of patients with multiple myeloma who are treated with Darzalex IV (daratumumab), study start date 01-Aug-2018, Closed: Jun-2022 
 Auditor’s Note: There were no off-label and suspected transmission of an infectious agent reports noted in the GMS ICSR Line Listing for the above NIS protocols. 
 2. For 1 out of 2 (50%) ongoing NIS protocol involving a product with a watchlist event, it was noted that the watchlist event was not described in the protocol. In addition, there was no evidence that the product watchlist was reviewed. TV-SOP-20172 requires that “watchlist requirements and reporting timelines for Janssen products of interest must be included in the protocol section for Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI)” and “The protocol should clarify the safety reporting requirements for Janssen products marketed in the studies disease area…”. Additional guidance was also included in the NIS protocol template stating, ""If no events on the watchlist require expedited reporting or the investigated product has no watchlist, document in other study documentation that the watchlist was reviewed and no events require inclusion"".  2.1. 61186372LUC4005  
 The amivantamab watchlist required reporting of lack of effect (LOE) within 24 hours of awareness since amivantamab is used for the treatment of a critical or life-threatening condition. The LOE watchlist event became effective in Jan-2024, however, the Investigator Safety Training (IST) that included LOE as a watchlist event only started in Mar-2024. 
 It was explained during the audit that the Study Responsible Scientist (SRS) or the Study Responsible Physician (SRP) usually received email communications for an updated watchlist and discussed with the local team if an action was needed due to the watchlist update. For avimantamab, the SRS/SRP did not receive the communication of the watchlist update in Jan-2024. However, during the update of the IST material by the Trial Delivery Manager (TDM) in Feb-2024, the watchlist for amivantamab was known and then shared with the SRS. 
  Auditor’s Note: There was no lack of effect cases noted in the GMS ICSR Line Listing for protocol 61186372LUC4005. 
 3. Evidence of follow-up for NIS ICSRs reviewed during the audit was not available for 8 out of 13 (62%) ICSRs. 
 TV-SOP-20172 requires the SM/Local Trial Manager/ designee to follow-up promptly with the Investigator to obtain follow-up information relevant to the ICSRs. It was explained that ICSR follow-up would be documented in the Site Manager's (SM) Monitoring Visit Reports (MVR) and/or email communications to the site requesting the missing report information such as patient’s age/age group, height, weight, other relevant history, concomitant medications, and/or event outcome. However, there was no documentation that follow-up was conducted for the following NIS ICSRs.

 It was explained post-audit that although specific AEs were not mentioned in the SM’s MVR, the safety reporting section indicated that the SM reminded the site that AEs and/or special situations are to be appropriately recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). However, this did not demonstrate that follow-up was conducted to obtain the missing information in the ICSRs reviewed.     CAPA champion: Adelman, Denise

 Sourcing of Auxiliary Medicinal Products in Clinical Trials was switched from central sourcing to local without prior Health Authority (HA) approval. 
 Description: On 14-Mar-2024, a change in the sourcing of Auxiliary Medicinal Products (AxMPs) for Spain was implemented without prior Health Authority (HA) approval as required under the European Union (EU) Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR). The switch involved transitioning from central to local sourcing of AxMPs (leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). While this practice had historical precedent under previous regulatory frameworks, it was not aligned with new EU CTR guidelines. 
 Note: Auxiliary medicinal product means a medicinal product used for the needs of a clinical trial as described in the protocol, but not as an investigational medicinal product. 
 The oversight was identified on 1-Oct-2024 by the regulatory team, following a query raised by the Spanish local team. On 12-Nov-2024, the substantiality of this modification was formally assessed and determined to require a submission of a Substantial Modification to the Health Authority. 
 Impact: Non-compliance with EU CTR guidelines.

 EU Clinical Trial Regulation [536/2014] (EU CTR) Chapter VIII, Article 53.2 requires that Sponsors submit to the Member States concerned, through the EU portal (CTIS), all inspection reports of third country authorities concerning the clinical trial. As part of the implementation of the regulation, procedural requirements were added to TV-SOP-09454 (Regulatory Authority Inspection Management v8.0) Section 4 regarding this requirement, however no third country inspection reports associated with trials conducted under EU CTR (The European Union Clinical Trial Regulation) have been submitted to the EU CTIS Portal (Clinical Trials Information System) (See Containment 1 for the list of trials submitted under EU CTR).   On 05 November 2024, the Associate Director of Clinical Operations reached out to the Process owner of TV-SOP-09454 that the third country inspection was conducted in Spain for 61186372NSC3002; however, they haven’t received a request till date to submit the document via CTIS. 
 On 14 November 2024, the Associate Director Clinical Operations, GCP inspection management lead and Process Owner of TV-SOP-09454 had a meeting. The GCP inspection management lead explained that although the requirement is described in TV-SOP-09454, the challenge is the actual “trigger” for the inspection management team to pull the appropriate inspection reports since Inspection Management does not have direct line of sight into trial content and timing of all EU submissions. The inspection management team would not know how to submit unless they have information that enables them to confirm the inspection trial scope of an EU submission.  During the meeting it was decided to open an Non-Conformance to document the issue.   It was also confirmed that no escalation record is required for this issue with the Vice President Quality Assurance & Compliance (See attachment “No escalation record require (REACT)”).  ",NC-026743,Internal,Annelies DE VOS,Annelies DE VOS,Open,Implement,"2024-12-12 12:45:57.0","2025-07-22 00:00:00.0",,,,,,

However, EC decision letter was signed by EC Head properly.   According to local regulations, delegated site staff who also has Ethics Committee member responsibilities cannot participate in discussions and vote on studies in which they are involved.     The Regulatory LTM continued to review EC decision letters signatures following the initial self identification. Delegated site staff signed attendance sheet of EC decision letters which belong to their delegated trials for multiple studies. This issue has been identified in attendance sheet of 41 decision letters from 4 ECs and a total of 6 trials have been affected: 61186372PANSC2001 (Oncology), 61186372PANSC2002 (Oncology), 61186372PANSC2003 (Oncology), 42756493BLC2002 (Oncology), 67896062CTP3001 (Cross-TA - closed), AC-065A310 (Cross-TA).

The SM at that time further checked and confirmed on 23 Oct 2024 that those documents were not submitted.   Unsubmitted documents were immediately submitted to IRB and reconsent for an affected subject was completed after getting IRB approval.   This issue was not considered a Significant Quality Issue(SQI) until we found several examples of falsified information documented by the responsible SM at that time. This finding prompted us to expand the investigation to other trials the SM was responsible for.   As a result, a further holistic investigation was conducted for all ongoing trials that the SM was responsible for. Similar issues were found in 61186372PANSC2002(PolyDamas) study, so it was decided to escalate this as a Significant Quality Issue.   During a co-monitoring visit on 06 Nov 2024 to one site in South Korea (61186372PANSC2002, KR10003) with the SM, the Local Trial Manager (LTM) identified that essential documents had not been submitted to the IRB. An investigation was initiated and confirmed that the SM had not timely submitted documents to the IRB for KR10003. It also determined that documents had not been timely submitted to the IRB at an additional site, KR10002. Specifically, the documents that were not provided to the IRB include the Protocol Amendment 2. Because it was not provided to the IRB in advance, this protocol was implemented without IRB approval. Additional documents not provided to the IRB include Investigator Brochures (IBs) and Informed Consent Forms (ICFs).   The specific references for these documents are as follows: -  Protocol PLATFORM AMD2_19Oct2023 KOR V3_28Nov2023 -  ISA2 AMD2_27Nov2023 KOR V2_07Dec2023 -  Investigator’s Brochure – Amivantamab Ed12_22Jul2024 -  Investigator’s Brochure – Cetrelimab Ed8_12Oct2023/Ed8_Add1 -  Main Informed Consent Form Platform V3_07Nov2023 -  Main ICF ISA2 V5_17Nov2023 -  Main ICF ISA2 V6_25Jul2024   The SM provided copies of protocol amendment booklets to the site, and the investigators and site staff enrolled patients based on the updated protocol after self-training without knowing that protocol amendment 2 was not approved by their IRB. The investigators didn’t use amended ICFs since SM didn’t provide them.   And in multiple visit reports, SM documented that the IRB review/approval is current and valid.   This SM encouraged the site to recruit participants based on the protocol amendment 2 and the eligibility criteria from the amended protocol.   As a result, the investigators and the site staff recruited participants based on the protocol amendment 2 that was not submitted/approved by IRB, whilst using outdated ICFs(Main ICF ISA2 V4_07Aug2023) instead of Main ICF ISA2 V5_17Nov2023 and Main ICF ISA V6_25Jul2024 .   Main ICF ISA2 V5_17Nov2023 was re-written to introduced cohort A and B, and Main ICF ISA2 V6_25Jul2024 included updated safety information. 8 participants included in these two sites did not sign either version.   Despite not being submitted and approved by the IRB, both protocol amendments(Protocol PLATFORM AMD2_19Oct2023 KOR V3_28Nov2023 and ISA2 AMD2_27Nov2023 KOR V2_07Dec2023) were submitted and approved by the South Korean Health Authority (HA). Site staff was trained on both protocols without awareness that either Protocol Amendments had not been approved by the IRB.   7 participants are in cohort A, representing 23% of the total sample (30 planned participants globally). All patients enrolled in Cohort A are eligible according to protocol amendment 1, which was the last approved version by the IRB. 1 participant is in cohort B and satisfied eligibility criteria of the protocol amendment 2, the version not approved by the IRB. All participants in cohort A and B met the eligibility criteria of the protocol amendment 2.   The Sponsor assessed there is no impact to the safety or to the rights of the participants in the serious breach reporting countries (UK, Spain, Italy, Poland and Turkey). However, because this issue involves the IRB’s inability to approve Protocol Amendment 2 prior to implementation, and the fact that eight patients had not provided consent through the latest ICF, the Sponsor assessed that there is a significant risk to the trial’s data reliability and robustness if patient data needs to be removed from the primary analysis. As a result, the Sponsor assessed the issue is a reportable serious breach as it is likely to significantly impact the trial’s data reliability and robustness in the serious breach reporting countries.   During the Serious Breach Meeting on 12 Dec 2024, it was confirmed that the other 3 studies in which this SM was involved (73841937NSC1001, CNTO148UCO3003 and CNTO1959UCO3001) were not considered as a serious breach.   Trial: 73841937NSC1001 The SM was responsible for IRB documentation at one site (KR10002 Principal Investigator: Kim, Dong-Wan) beginning 10OCT2023. Documents impacted: two IBs (for Amivantamab and for Lazertinib), ICF v15, the IRB Annual Progress Report 2024 and memo informing about enrollment closure to Cohort E and F. 
 The Annual Progress Report was submitted to the IRB on 28NOV2024. Approval is expected by 20DEC2024. Other documents will be submitted to the IRB after the report is approved, The updated version of the ICF will be signed by seven participants impacted after the IRB approval is obtained. These seven participants represent 1% of the total of the 701 participants enrolled globally in the study and 0.6% participants enrolled to Cohort A, 0.9% enrolled to Cohort C, 0.9% enrolled to Cohort E and 3.7% enrolled to Cohort F. 
 The Sponsor therefore assessed for trial 73841937NSC1001 that the issue has no impact to the participants in the EU and that it is not likely to significantly impact the trial’s data reliability and robustness. 
 Trial: CNTO148UCO3003 Documents impacted include four IB’s of the comparator (Remicade), ICF v8 and two protocol amendments. The updated version of the ICF was signed 18NOV2024 after the IRB approval by the one patient impacted. 
 This patient was in golimumab cohort, representing 1.4% of the total 69 participants enrolled in the golimumab cohort. 
 The Sponsor therefore assessed for trial CNTO148UCO3003 that the issue has no impact to the participants in the EU and that it is not likely to significantly impact the trial’s data reliability and robustness. 
 Trial: CNTO1959UCO3001 Documents impacted: IB (Guselkumab), Main ICF v10 and v11, Local ICF (Human Material), Protocol Amendment 3 and the IRB Annual Progress Reports of 2023 and 2024. 
 The updated version of the ICF included additional 2-year extension of the LTE phase. The updated versions of the Main ICF and Human Material ICF will be signed by the six participants impacted after the IRB approval. These six participants represent 0.6% of the total of the 1064 participants enrolled globally in the study.

It was also noted that although the recent CNTO4424 20Kg and 65Kg chromatograms were deemed to be representative, as per TV-SOP-48797 “CNTO4424 65kg Product Specific SOP” version 12.0 and TV-SOP-41085 “CNTO4424 20Kg (JNJ-61186372) Product Specific SOP” version 15.0 there had been a change to the typical profile due to a decrease in absorbance during collection. 
 The changes to the UV profiles for the CNTO148 and CNTO4424 batches in the scope of this NC was first highlighted as part of a review of a decrease in overall batch yield for CNTO148 12kg batch PO#392175. This prompted a review of all step yields for CNTO148 12Kg and a decrease in PS1 step yields was noted. 
 On further review it was noted that there was a decrease in the PS1 step yield for all three CNTO148 12Kg batches (PO#392175, 392223, 392217). During the investigation some minor changes in the UV profile of the batches was evident when compared with the historical chromatograms for CNTO148 12Kg. Typically during elution, the UV absorbs to a maximum of 3.3AU but in this instance PO#392223 maxed out to approximately 1.0AU, 392175 maxed out to approximately 0.8AU and PO#392217 maxed out to approximately 0.75AU.  
 As a result of the decrease in absorbance identified for the three CNTO148 12Kg batches, UV absorbance on SK500 was reviewed for recent batches processed in DSP1. On further review, it was deemed that CNTO4424 20Kg batches PO#391374, 391621 and 391622 and CNTO4424 65Kg batch 391197 were in scope of this NC-030851. During loading, the absorbance is expected to max out at 3.3 AU for both CNTO4424 20Kg and 65kg. On further review on PI of the SK500 UV Meter (P014506AI131) by MPS CJMP, it was noted that the UV absorbance maxed out at 1.8 AU for 391197 (CNTO4424 65Kg), 1.4AU for PO#391374, 1.35AU for PO#391621 and 1.2AU for PO#391622. Based on review on PI by MPS CJMP back to the previous UV Cal on SK500 which was performed on 19Nov2024 under SAP WO 7329708 , no further batches were in scope of this NC prior to the initial issues observed on PO#391197

 Bioassay/Campaign: C24447374 
 QC Analyst: DPR1 
 Problem Statement: 
 On 18Dec2024 in Bioassay Lab A.02.02.16, QC Analyst DPR1 performed Dot Blot testing of CNTO4424 samples 242224010 and 242235100 as per TV-TMD-15652 v3.0, 'JNJ-61186372 Dot Blot Identification Assay Test Method', recorded on C24447374. Upon review of this assay on 08Jan2025, QC Analyst ANN3 observed that the final testing concentration of these samples did not align with TV-TMD-15652 V3.0 section 6.2.4. It was identified that the 2nd dilution step resulted in a final testing concentration of 1600ng/ml and not 400 ng/ml as per TV-TMD-15652 V3.0. It was confirmed by QC Technical Expert SRA and NDR that LME C24447374 met all assay and sample acceptance criteria as per TV-TMD-15652 v3.0. Samples 242224010 and 242235100 met all specifications as per TV-SPEC-54414 V10.0 'Amivantamab Drug Substance (50 mg/mL) Laboratory Specifications'. 
 On 08Jan2025 it was identified by QC Analyst ANN3 that the incorrect assay buffer and sample volumes are available for selection within the 'Sample Preparation Dilution Step 2' section of assay LME ""EL-CB-DOTBLOT-CNTO4424"". 
 Due to the incorrect buffer and sample volumes available for selection in dilution step 2 JNJ-61186372 test articles 242224010 and 242235100 had a final testing concentration of 1600ng/mL, the result should have 400ng/mL ar per TV-TMD-15652 V3.0. A search of previous CNTO4424 dot blot LME assays was performed by QC Analyst AEB on 08Jan2025 and it was identified that this error affected all CNTO4424 dot blots tested on eLIMS since 16Apr2023, which used eLIMS template EL-CB-DOTBLOT-CNTO4424 (versions 4,5,6 and 7). NC-030721 was raised by QC Analyst AEB on 09Jan2025. On 10Jan2025, Malvern SME JS was notified of the issue. 
 Required Condition: 
 As per TV-TMD-15652 v3.0, section 6.2.4, the required final testing concentration for JNJ-61186372 test articles is 400 ng/mL. 
 Actual Condition: 
 JNJ-61186372 test articles 242224010 and 242235100 were incorrectly tested as incorrect sample volumes for the dilution step 2 were used resulting in the incorrect final concentration of 1600ng/mL.

 Purpose of Testing: CNTO4424 ADCC Gen 1 Samples are routinely tested in the Cork Quality Control (QC) Bioassay lab for Bioactivity as per TV-TMD-31640 v3.0. 
 Once the assay is complete, the final reportable result is entered into eLIMS as per TV-SOP-26983 v24.0 section 5.11.1. The data entry is then verified by a second analyst per TV-SOP-26983 v24.0 section 5.14.1 ensuring the transcription has been performed correctly. 
 Problem Statement: On 05Sep2023 (Day 1)/06Sep2023 (Day 2) QC Analyst DJK8 performed CNTO 4424 ADCC Bioassay on samples 231151168 and 231179717 (ref. Bioassay-23-1254/C23257389) as per TV-TMD-31640 v3.0. On 07Sep2023, QC Analyst DJK8 entered a Bioactivity result of 93% for sample 231151168 and 94% for sample 231179717, which was reviewed by QC Analyst ACB on 07Sep2023. 
 On 10Jan2025, QC Batch Release Analyst CH94 requested a transcription of the results into a new campaign with the most updated eLIMS template for the commercial release of 4424 30kg batches 363376C and 363377C. On 13Jan2025 QC Analyst MABR transcribed the Bioactivity result of 93% for sample 231151168 and 94% for sample 231179717 from C23257389 into a new campaign C25014024, which was reviewed by QC Analyst ACB on 13Jan2025. The data entry for samples 231151168 and 231179717 in campaign C23257389 was cancelled by MABR on 13Jan2025 upon transcription. The occurrence was initially documented as 13Jan2025 which was when the transcription was performed on campaign id C25014024 . However, on further assessment, it was identified that the transcription error occurred on 07Sep2023. 
 
 On 22Jan2025, the data entry of sample 231179717 was reopened in C23257389 by QC Specialist ECC1 in error as part of an action for NC-030721. 
 On 25Jan2025, QC Analyst GJM notified QC Specialist ECC1 that sample 231179717 Bioactivity results had been reported incorrectly on C23257389 compared to softmax file JSC Live Data/2023/Bioassay-23-1254. On 27Jan2025, QC Analyst MABR corrected the value of sample 231179717 from 94% to 93% in C23257389 in error instead of C25014024, which was reviewed by QC Analyst ANN3 on 27Jan2025. 
 On 06Feb2025, while authoring new regulatory COAs (i.e. COAs requested for specific markets) for batches 363376C and 363377C post QP release, NPI-PLCM Associate Scientist CITM identified inconsistencies on the EGFR ADCC Bioactivity result which was “Cancelled” versus the result which was “Completed”, per Jasper report outline. This was queried with QC Specialist ECC1, and it was discovered that the original transcription on 07Sep2023 from Softmax raw data to the QC Campaign was incorrect. On 10Feb2025, QC Analyst MABR corrected the value of sample 231179717 from 94% to 93% and the value of sample 231151168 from 93% to 94% in C25014024, which was reviewed by QC Analyst ACB on 11Feb2025.   
 Upon completion of the assay on 06Sep2023, samples 231151168 and 231179717 met all assay and sample acceptance criteria as per TV-TMD-31640 v3.0 and were within specification as per TV-SPEC-54414 v10.0 (75-125% both samples) with a final reportable results of 94% for 231151168 and 93% for 231179717. However, the incorrect transcription of results was not identified either upon review by QC Analyst ACB or upon the following transcriptions/corrections of data by QC Analysts MABR and ANN3. 
 This is a non-conformance as per TV-SOP-26983 v24.0 section 5.14 Data Verification 'This is the step in the sample life cycle whereby the correctness of the data entered into eLIMS is verified versus the applicable supporting documentation (i.e. worksheet, logbook, instrument printout)' 
 Nonconformance was not raised on the 06Feb2025 due to a required assessment to confirm the impact of the transcription error. This assessment was completed with NPI-PLCM Associate Scientist CITM where a review of all the associated reports were the incorrect transcribed results were used .This assessment was completed on the 11Feb2025 where it was confirmed that this transcription error impacted QC batch release reports. NC-033396 was raised as a result. 
 Required Condition: As per TV-SOP-26983 v24.0 section 5.14 Data Verification 'This is the step in the sample life cycle whereby the correctness of the data entered into eLIMS is verified versus the applicable supporting documentation (i.e. worksheet, logbook, instrument printout)'. 
 Actual Condition: The final reportable results for samples 231151168 and 231179717 were incorrectly reported in eLIMS as 93% for 231151168 and 94% for 231179717. The correct final result for are 94% for 231151168 and 93% for 231179717. Upon final review of Bioassay-23-1254/C23257389, the data entry error was not identified.

The SM confirmed the error on 6 Feb 2025, and the next dose was scheduled for 11-Feb-2025. 
 The investigator referred to the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS, the IWRS system is the automated system that centrally manages subject randomization and medication assignment) transaction note that indicated the vial strength of 360 mg, rather than consulting the protocol and the Investigational Product Preparation and Administration Information (IPPI). Despite proper training on Cetrelimab dosing provided by the SM during Site Initiation Visit (SIV), the site staff did not adhere to the correct protocol due to reliance on the transaction note.
