Two of the three Critical Observations are repeat observations from the previous audits conducted at IQVIA (JUN2018 ESP2018Q22406 and FEB2020 ESP2020Q13534), highlighting the insufficient mitigation actions implemented.   

Below is a summary of the three Critical Observations:
•	Significant Monitoring and Site Management deficiencies related to Monitoring and Pharmacy visits not conducted, not conducted in a timely manner, and/or not reported in a timely manner per the approved monitoring plans for the studies included in the audit sample. 

•	Significant IQVIA Trial Master File (Wingspan) deficiencies related to the completeness and the contemporaneousness filing of essential document in the TMF. Quality control processes to ensure the quality of the TMF were also found deficient and not robust. This is a repeat Critical Audit Observation from both the 2018 and 2020 Audits.

•	Deficient issue management and escalation processes as evidenced by failure to create Quality Issues (QI), delays in creating and reporting the QIs and insufficient tracking and oversight of the QIs. This is a repeat Critical Audit Observation from the 2018 Audit. Consequently, these deficiencies also contributed to delays in Janssen awareness and delays in Janssen processing and escalating of these quality issues. In addition, the CAPA management at IQVIA was also found deficient with action plans not created to proactively remediate significant/systemic issues, untimely closure of CAPA, inadequate documentation of root causes, and unclear assessment of Effectiveness Checks. 

In addition, six Major Observations were identified and reported in the Audit Report.

The management of the related action plans, including the development of Corrections and Corrective/Preventative Actions to address the Observations in the audit report, will adhere to the BRQC QA audit reporting processes.

Issue background and description:
Following the departure of the Kenyan Local Safety Officer (LSO) in Q2 2021, routine LSO handover activities identified three quality issues relating to gaps in the local Pharmacovigilance system. Ranging back to 2018, these include:
- missed reporting of six monthly SUSAR line listings (1989387)
- 19 solicited Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from PSPs not reported to the Kenyan HA, (which have now been reported) (1976274)
- missed and late (Pharma and Consumer product) Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to the Kenyan HA.(1981857)

Preliminary review identified that a total of 8 SUSAR line listings (out of 14) were not submitted to Kenyan HA for the HIV VAC89220HPX2003 clinical trial. From 2018 to date, 14 PSURs (26%) were not submitted, 11 were submitted late (21%), and 3 (6%) submitted with a wrong date documented in the regulatory system (Insight). There is no risk to patient safety or to the benefit risk profile of the products. Further review is ongoing to ensure no other PV system gaps exist. This is expected to conclude mid-Aug.

	M3 (critical finding – (site and sponsor) 27OCT2021
	
The following deficiencies were identified regarding GCP compliance of patient record documentation (source data documentation) recorded in the clinical site electronic health record system (ALBIS):

Lack of audit trail, non-compliance with ALCOA principles 
1. The electronic patient record, which was initially defined as a medium for recording source data, is not technically suitable for ensuring the traceability of entries: An audit trail is not available. Changed entries are provided with a current time stamp, but the nature of the change is not apparent. Furthermore, it is possible to delete entries completely. A log file generated by the system, which stores accesses to records, is overwritten by the system on a quarterly basis. The integrity of the data stored in the electronic file was thus negatively affected in that any modifications and deletions are not clearly represented. This is particularly relevant for data that was subsequently printed after the facts described in deficiency D2 became known.

Inadequate or missing verification of the suitability of the conditions and processes at the study site with regard to the source data documentation.
2.	The information provided by the study site to the sponsor regarding the technical conditions (survey using the Electronic Source Data Compliance Assessment Questionnaire) was repeatedly incorrect, even after the conditions described in item 1 and in deficiency D2 became known.
3.	Formally, the electronic patient record is still defined in the document ""Source Document Identification and Agreement"" is still defined as an electronic medium for source data, even if it was newly created on August 20, 2019. This is also supported by the fact that an additional ""Electronic Source Data Compliance Assessment Questionnaire"" was completed, which according to the form is only required if an electronic system is used as the source data medium.
4.	There is a lack of specifications regarding the frequency and type of printouts of the electronic file to ensure that changes are mapped or that the ALCOA principles are fulfilled.
5.	It is unclear why the present systems were accepted by the sponsor. An initial check of the information provided by the study site is not evident.


	Reference: ICH E6 (R2) [EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995]: 4.9.0 together with 2.10 and 2.13, also 5.6.1 and 5.18.4 b)

	6.2.1

Noted by the inspector in the final report: The critical identified at the time of the inspection is unlikely to impact patient safety, but is systematic with respect to the conduct of the clinical study at the site. The deficiency did not affect the approval of the clinical study, but it did negatively affect the validity and trustworthiness of the data collected (procedures for implementing electronic systems and their documented validation).  The data entered into the ALBIS system is printed and stored in patient binders. The inspector reviewed two of the seven printed patient files against the clinical site electronic data base (ALBIS) and the inspectors were provided access to the eCRF and did not reveal any apparent discrepancies

Public Health England, which is a governmental institute under UK Health Security Agency, informed approached  Janssen on 31-Mar-22 that this issue could result in a potential serious breach reporting event, according to PHE procedures.

Issue 
67 humoral samples to assess neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV 2 across 2 assays for the VAC31518COV2001 (COV2001) trial analyzed at Public Health England (PHE) were found to be invalid after the data was submitted to FDA and EMA. COV2001 Group 9 10 DAY 197 data became available in the form of Tables, Listings and Figures on 18 Jan 2022. Review of these data and comparison with the S-ELISA data identified unexpected results. Janssen requested for PHE to further investigate the incongruent data on 27 Jan 2022. On 16 Mar 2022 PHE informed Janssen via email of preliminary investigation results suggesting mishandling of data samples by lab operator. They opened a non-conformance in their system the next day after meeting with the Janssen team.

On 29 March 2022 PHE reported the results of their non-conformance investigation confirmed 67 samples across 14 plates conducted across 2 assays were invalidated due to incorrect handling by the lab operator and data previously uploaded to Janssen in June 2021 were inaccurate. Janssen requested a retest of all 67 samples the same day. 

Impact
The results of the 2 inaccurate assays were reported in multiple regulatory submissions including:

•	COV2001 TLR used for EMA and FDA booster applications: EDMS RIM 518007
•	ACO for FDA booster application: EDMS RIM 515644

Patient 100097 was enrolled into Cohort 12a and did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. This patient had a fatal event (death secondary to multi-organ failure) on 09 May 2022.  

The criteria selected for escalation:
Inappropriate randomization of a subject into a clinical trial e.g. a subject that did not meet protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria was enrolled, resulting in potential/significant risk to subject's safety.

Brief/succinct summary of issue
This event is currently considered a potential Significant Quality Issue per TV-SOP-25014 as it represented an immediate risk to patient safety. 

- Patient 100097 at site ES10002 (PI: Norma Carmen Gutierrez) was dosed with 400 mg of the IP as a third step up dose, as indicated by protocol (this was the 2nd highest dosing cohort in the study). After dosing, the patient developed Grade 3 CRS with Grade 5 fever, and subsequently died due to multiple organ failure. CRS is a known event with bispecific antibody therapy, having been reported 33 times in this study with 3 prior Grade 3 events. The Grade 5 fever was initially judged to be unrelated to IP.
- During the follow-up investigation, the central team discovered that the patient did not meet multiple entry criteria for the study. Each deviation of entry criteria is considered a major protocol deviation (MPD).
The MPDs were related to the following:
- Last IT therapy was administered from 07 Apr 2022 to 19 Apr 2022 (day -15 to day -4). CNS disease and intrathecal therapy (IT) treatment information was not available in the eCRF during eligibility review. According to exclusion criteria 4.2 the patient cannot have prior therapy two weeks before the first administration of study drug. 
- Patient had platelets = 50 at pre-dose without bone marrow involvement of the disease. This was out of range per inclusion criteria 4b. 

Initial IND safety report submitted on 20 May 2022.  FDA sent an Information Request to Janssen on 27 May 2022, with a requirement to respond no later than 01 June 2022 (deadline extended to 03 June 2022).  Janssen response is in progress.

However, the recommendation provided to the Sponsor Committee by the IDMC on 21Mar22 was to stop the study (no reason specified). The recruitment was then stopped, and patients continued in double blind phase potentially delaying their transition to open label treatment.

The AC-077A301 (A DUE) trial Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) completed their review of the Interim Analysis (IA) data in March 2022 with recommendation to stop the study per the blinded IDMC meeting report.  In review of communications from March 2022 between the IDMC and the SC the understanding of this recommendation was that the study was to stop recruitment of new patients and complete the final planned analysis; however, upon review of the closed session meeting minutes in November 2022 the IDMC had recommended to stop the study due to efficacy - which was not done.

Trigger for Escalation:   AIFA (HA Italy) placed a conditional approval for the SunRIse trials, requesting a separate CIA (clinical investigation application) for the Urinary Placement Catheter (UPC) device, and requested a temporary enrollment hold on November 15th 2023.  

Background: The UPC is used for the intravesical placement of TAR-200 in the bladder. It does not have a CE mark and is a low-risk, Class I sterile device. The four SunRIse studies were designed to evaluate TAR-200 alone or in combination with cetrelimab and are not a clinical evaluation of the UPC to demonstrate conformity nor to evaluate or establish the performance, clinical benefit, or safety of the UPC. Therefore, per Article 62 (1) of the MDR, it was the opinion of the Sponsor at the time of trial design and start that a clinical investigation application to the health authority for this Class I sterile, low-risk device separate to the CTA application for the TAR-200 integral drug-device combination product was not warranted and confirmed with the Italian HA. 
  
AIFA has now communicated with the local team that the UPC device should have a Clinical Investigation Agreement (CIA) submitted for each study in order to resolve this issue.  AIFA asked to place a hold on enrolment for all SunRIse studies until the CIA is approved for use of the UPC device for SR 1, 2, 3, and 4 studies.   This impacts patients in screening (no ICF signed) by November 15th 2023, but patients on treatment can continue treatment.

The Sponsor acknowledges the understanding device-related requirements have evolved in the past years and has agreed to submit a separate CIA application as soon as possible.

Next Steps:
A Clinical Investigation Application (CIA) for the UPC device will be submitted for all SunRIse studies (SunRIse, 1, 2, 3, 4) to the AIFA.  An enrolment hold for new patients will be put in place until approval, which is expected to be expedited in under 60 days to minimize impact.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2023-11-15 20:14:36.000,"CLAES, ROBBY","Next Steps:

•	The site staff, including study coordinators, pharmacists, sub-investigators, and nurses, were performing study procedures without the required study training. The pharmacist did not have the necessary credentials, and there were errors in the preparation and administration of investigational products including the usage of outdated forms. 
•	Delays occurred in obtaining reconsent from study participants for multiple versions for several months, and there were issues with documentation process. 
•	Delegation log was updated after the announcement of the audit, with numerous changes without evidence of training in some cases.
•	Urological procedures were performed by partner institutions, leading to concerns about data completeness since only summaries are provided and not the original source. 
•	Protocol deviations and safety reports were not handled according to required timelines outlined by their local Ethics Committee. 
•	There were delays in reviewing study documents and SUSAR (instances were reviewed 1 year later), and not all necessary training was completed in a timely manner. 
•	Site uses a platform with username and password for the generation of source documents, which they print and sign for the medical chart, with no procedure to explain how it should be handled.

- Potential formal notification to Health Authorities (HA) and Business Partners (BP)
- Significant volume of late Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) submissions to EMA and MHRA

On 11-Jun-2024, during the close-out meeting of the Belgium FAMHP supervisory inspection (4th-11th June 2024), the inspectors communicated potential findings. This included reference to under-reporting to Eudravigilance for a small number of spontaneous cases where the reporter did not provide causality and company causality was considered as Not Related.  Self-identified NC-014879 was opened on 20-Jun-2024. Inspection report received 11-Jul-2024 confirmed a major observation related to this finding.  On 29-Jul-2024, during the ongoing investigation, the escalation lead was informed of a projected number of approx. 350 submissions identified as under-reported to the EMA and MHRA respectively. Impact to overall compliance will be low. 

An impact assessment on patient safety will be performed, but impact is unlikely because all cases were included in the safety database.

UPDATE 01-Aug-2024:  On 31-Jul-2024, the Case Processing Director confirmed the final numbers of missed submissions to EMA and MHRA as 78 and 71 respectively, instead of the earlier projected figures. These are not considered a significant compliance impact.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2024-07-29 16:17:44.000,"CHAHAL, AMIT",QI and CPA in progress,No Subsequent Escalation,
