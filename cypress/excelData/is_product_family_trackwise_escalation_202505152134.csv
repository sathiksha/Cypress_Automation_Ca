The use of the incorrect version did not include the most current risk language.   The incorrect version (V9) of the ICF was used from the beginning of the trial (first patient dosed 01July2021) therefore, subjects were not informed of the most current risk language.  Currently, there are 562 subjects enrolled at 144 sites.

Background Information:
On 07February2023, a review of the South Korean ICF (Informed Consent Form) was conducted by the study scientist Karen Bensley. During the review, the scientist noticed that the risk language from version 9 ( 31July2018) was used in the Master ICF. However, at the time of Master ICF development for this study (CNTO1959PSA3004), version 12   was the current version that should have been used (20 December 2019). 

The following are examples of the risk language, that was not included in the ICF when patients were consented: 
-common risk: Increased level of liver enzymes in the blood (transaminases)
-uncommon risk: Decreased number of a type of white blood cell (neutrophils)
-Herpes simplex infections, which may appear as blisters or sores on the lips (cold sores) or genitals (genital herpes), Fungal skin infections (for example athlete’s foot), Gastroenteritis (an infection of the stomach and/or intestine).

In addition, there were risks descriptions that were not up to date:  Injection site reactions (redness, pain, bruising, swelling, itching, hardness, skin irritation, bleeding and/or rash at the place where the injection is given), Serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), which may appear as hives, swollen face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat, difficulty swallowing or breathing, low blood pressure or lightheadedness.   
Immediate actions:
-The Master ICF is being updated to include the correct risk language for submission to the EC’s/IRB for approval. (date TBD)
-The clinical team will notify the investigator sites by memo   of this issue and provide details on how to verbally inform patients while the Master ICF is pending approval from the ECs/IRB. (date TBD)
-All subjects currently enrolled in the trial will be reconsented with the full ICF amendment at their next scheduled visit after EC/IRB approval. For subject’s who are planning to dose at home, a phone call will be scheduled set up to inform the subject of the updated risk language before their next planned IP administration day and document the call in the source. .",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2023-02-21 15:02:21.000,"PATEL, BHAVESH",Additional actions to be determine.

The audit was performed in Monterrey, Mexico on 12-14 Mar 2024.

The auditor noted significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on lack of Principal Investigator (PI) oversight resulting in several issues related to delegation, training, ICF, filing/ study documents review, compliance with local Ethics Committee PD and SUSAR submission timelines, SUSAR reviews and IP.

Background
The Study 17000139BLC3001 is a phase 3 study, to assess the efficacy of TAR-200 in combination with Cetrelimab versus concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in participants with Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIBC) of the bladder who are not receiving radical cystectomy. 

The audited Site S71-MX10004 was opened on 25Nov21 and has screened 21 participants starting 08Apr22 (first subject screened), and has enrolled 10 participants. 

Issue description 
•	The site staff, including study coordinators, pharmacists, sub-investigators, and nurses, were performing study procedures without the required study training. The pharmacist did not have the necessary credentials, and there were errors in the preparation and administration of investigational products including the usage of outdated forms. 
•	Delays occurred in obtaining reconsent from study participants for multiple versions for several months, and there were issues with documentation process. 
•	Delegation log was updated after the announcement of the audit, with numerous changes without evidence of training in some cases.
•	Urological procedures were performed by partner institutions, leading to concerns about data completeness since only summaries are provided and not the original source. 
•	Protocol deviations and safety reports were not handled according to required timelines outlined by their local Ethics Committee. 
•	There were delays in reviewing study documents and SUSAR (instances were reviewed 1 year later), and not all necessary training was completed in a timely manner. 
•	Site uses a platform with username and password for the generation of source documents, which they print and sign for the medical chart, with no procedure to explain how it should be handled.

Per Site Manager (SM) source data review (SDR) on 14Feb2024 at site HU10007, it appeared that the Mayo Patient Diary Cards for patient 100893 may have been completed by the Sub-Investigator (SI) instead of by the patient as the date in the header looked like the SI’s handwriting. 

According to SI interview on 29Apr2024, patients brought their notes to the clinic which were used for Mayo diary completion. These patient notes were not retained at the site after the data were transcribed to the Diary Card and eCRF. 

Per protocol, Mayo Diaries should be completed by the patients at home before the study visits. These data are used to calculate the Mayo score which informs various endpoints.

There is a potential impact on data integrity as the data entered into eCRF cannot be verified against original patient source. 

An internal routine site audit was planned for FUZION (CNTO1959CRD3005) as this is a high enroller and was extended to include QUASAR (CNTO1959UCO3001) to focus on this issue. This audit is planned for 08-12Jul2024.

Additional Details: 
At site HU10007, 11 patients were enrolled, 6 early terminated, 1 completed, and 4 are ongoing in the long-term extension. A total of 1064 patients were enrolled in the QUASAR study.

Potential issue was initially identified in February 2024 as a result of a new SM conducting a routine monitoring visit.  Additional monitoring visits were conducted by the local GCO team from March to April 2024.  The date in the header of the diary card might be the handwriting of the SI for approximately 135 of 208 (65%) visits.

As part of an MHRA inspection and based on their final inspection findings, it was communicated to the J&J employee (Product Stewardship) that the data can no longer be considered suitable for regulatory submission or decision making and the claim of GLP compliance is rescinded for the specified study (TD85VM).

Impact: The issue appears to be limited to one study (as site was not in use for any other study) and with the initial MAA this study was not used for conclusion/approval. It is noted that advanced environmental fate and effect tests were done in assumption that API would not be readily biodegradable which waived actual need for the biodegradability study. The one study identified to be impacted is already included in ERA package included in MAA for rilipivirine (EMA agency).

J&J Actions: EMA released a new ERA Guideline in March 2024 where the ready biodegradability test is required for submission. With the obligation of applicants to take due account of scientific/regulatory progress, this study must be submitted within the 18 Month transition period (2026/2027). A follow up meeting is scheduled for 06 Jun 2024 with applicable Labcorp representatives, J&J business partners and pertinent J&J Quality Assurance representatives to obtain additional details related to this incident- to ensure a thorough assessment is completed and determine the next action steps from J&J.

Description of Issue:
In January 2023, biodegradation‐related study services were suspended at the Shardlow, UK site pending a review of concerns raised by a staff member of improper sample handling and data management practices. Labcorp immediately notified the MHRA of this concern. MHRA initiated an inspection at the Labcorp Shardlow site in February 2023. Labcorp worked cooperatively with the MHRA during the inspection throughout 2023 and early 2024.

MHRA recently provided Labcorp its inspection report, which included critical and major findings, including but not  limited to the following: Source/Raw Data, Data Integrity, Test Facility Management Responsibilities etc (see attached doc for more detail). 

Labcorp's Impact Assessment:
Based on MHRA’s inspection findings, Labcorp is required to rescind the claim of GLP compliance for all Biodegradation studies that were active or initiated from 24 December 2018 and the data can no longer support regulatory submission or decision making.
(Refer to attached CAPA document for additional details). The incident impacts one study - TD85VM – OECD 301B - Rilpivirine Hydrochloride (TMC278)

Owning Department: Supplier Contracting Services

- System Prompt ‐ develop a prompt in the system that will remind contract requestors to attach the TOM for DM WOs.  Initial due date 14 Jun 2024, expected completion date 27 Jul 2024
- Supplier Contract Services will update the Playbook to provide clear guidance on the TOM (i.e. appending to WO where necessary).  Initial due date 07 Jun 2024, expected completion date 28 Jun 2024
- Supplier Contract Services will conduct retraining on the updated playbook to ensure there is team awareness of the documents required.  Initial due date 07 Jun 2024, expected completion date 28 Jun 2024

Risk evaluation: These commitments were made in response to observation 1 (Data Management oversight) as needed process improvements for onboarding of new Data Management Suppliers by the Supplier Contracting Services group.  The delayed completion for the Playbook and associated training (3 weeks past committed due date) and delayed implementation of of additional system prompt reminders (6 weeks past committed due date) is considered low risk, as there are no new Data Management suppliers planned for onboarding before the commitments are completed per the expected completion dates noted in the table above.  

Preliminary Cause assessment: These 3 Supplier Contracting Services (GS_PRC_NA_Contracting) commitments had completion timeframes of between four and six weeks, set at the direction of the owning function. The timeframes may not have been conservatively realistic to allow for unplanned circumstances. 

Contributing factor: Because these additional commitments were resubmitted to Health Canada per their request to redress the initial insufficient response, the Core Inspection Team made a decision to await response acceptance by Health Canada prior to opening COMET NC records.  As no NC records were opened between 08 May 2024 and 21 June 2024, there was a lack of oversight by Quality to track the completion of the near due commitments in the QMS and to follow-up with the commitment owner.

The audit was performed in Beijing, China on 27-29 May 2024.

The auditor noted significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on lack of site process in maintaining the blind for the study, resulting unblinding/ potential unblinding in 3 of 4 randomized subjects. 

Background
The Study 80202135CDP3001 is a phase 2/3 study, Multistage, Multicenter, Randomized, Doubled-Blind, Placebo- Controlled Parallel Group Withdrawal study to evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Nipocalimab Administered to Adults with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy 

The audited Site W23-CN10003 was initiated on 20Oct2022 and has screened 7 subjects starting 13Jan2023 (first subject screened), and has enrolled 5 subjects, out of which 4 subjects were randomized in the Stage B (double-blind, placebo-controlled) of the study. 

Issue description 
Unblinded investigational product (IP) information including IP medication number and subject’s treatment assignment were wrongly provided to two (2) blinded investigators who were responsible for primary/secondary/exploratory efficacy endpoints assessments. It affected 3 out of 4 randomized subjects at the site.

1.	Unblinding to one (1) investigator (Investigator A) responsible for efficacy endpoints assessments was noted. Investigator A signed the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) treatment assignment confirmation sheets and performed efficacy endpoints assessments for subsequent 2 study visits after unblinding. It affected 2 out of 4 randomized subjects.

2.	Potential risk of unblinding for one (1) investigator (Investigator B) was previously identified by ICON. IP medication numbers were mistakenly provided to Investigator B for 3 out of 4 randomized subjects and Investigator B continued with efficacy endpoint assessment for these subjects till the audit.

The above potential unblinding issue for Investigator B had been identified by ICON prior to the audit and a major protocol deviation and actions had been reported and implemented. 

However, the investigation and corrective action and preventative action (CAPA) were inadequate as the unblinding issue for Investigator A was not identified as part of the investigation of potential unblinding issue for Investigator B. 

In addition, the potential risk of unblinding issue was evaluated as non-quality issue by ICON as it was determined that 3 affected subjects were considered as insignificant. It was confirmed by Janssen study team that there had been no action taken for Investigator B despite the potential risk of unblinding.

Participants 111408 and 104776 continued to take a previously prescribed anticoagulant after they were randomized into the AFL3002 study and were dispensed IP, each for approximately 1 month.  Neither participant has reported adverse events related to this use of prohibited concomitant medications.  

A major Quality Issue was initially reported by IQVIA (DEVN-MS-2024-2824) on 11 September to investigate the most recent case for participant 111408.    The QI was upgraded to critical on 13 September.   Upon identification of the earlier case for participant104776, the JNJ team instructed IQVIA to include the earlier case as part of the QI investigation.  No other cases were identified.  The root cause is under investigation.  

The site has screened 12 participants, randomized 10 participants and had 2 screen failures.  

The administration of additional anticoagulation medication may have the potential to significantly impact patient safety. Although actual bleeding events did not occur, the two participants were at higher risk of bleeding than what is associated with standard of care or intended by the study protocol.  In addition, the two cases indicate a possible systemic trend with providing clear instructions to study participants about discontinuing oral anticoagulation therapy after randomization to the study.  

Participant 111408 was randomized on 22 July 2024 to receive Apixaban 5 mg or placebo and Milvexian 100 mg or placebo.  The participant was taking Endoxaban 60 mg once daily prior to entering the study, starting on 12 April 2024.  According to the protocol, the participant should have stopped taking Endoxaban once they were randomized and dispensed study IP however, they did not.  IP was temporarily discontinued on 27 August due to a missed site visit and they were instructed to continue with temporary Endoxaban until they could return to the site.  They returned for their Week 4 visit on 03 September 2024 at which time the issue was identified, subsequently the participant was instructed to discontinue the Endoxaban.  The participant has not reported any Adverse Events related to this issue and their Week 4 hemoglobin levels were stable.  The participant is continuing with IP for the study. 

During investigation, the JNJ study team identified a similar case at the same Investigator site.  Participant 104776 was randomized on 12 March 2024 and assigned IP (milvexian 100 mg/placebo, Apixaban 5 mg/placebo) for the AFL3002 study.   They were taking Apixaban 5 mg BID (former prescribed medication) at that time however did not discontinue it at the time of randomization to study IP.  They later stopped taking concomitant Apixaban on 10 April 2024 after the issue was identified by the participant’s general practitioner who informed the site about the case.  Participant was advised to immediately stop taking Apixaban and continue taking only IP.   This event was recorded as a Major Protocol deviation.

At 04:20 UTC on 21-Jul-2024, during the incorporation of Chinese regulations into the gateway certificates, the existing production and validation certifications were inadvertently revoked by the certification vendor, GoDaddy. The issue was explored with ArisGlobal (global safety system vendor), as well as GoDaddy, however, it was not possible to reinstate the impacted certificates. This has resulted in the need to install new certificates, which will lead to late submissions. Due to the complexity of the installation and dependence on BP and HA response times, it is difficult to predict exact numbers for this issue.  The issue has been projected to possibly impact ~40,000 ICSR submissions (note: not all would be late).  Figures are based on current average volumes with each BP and HA.

Daily monitoring will be in place until resolution and closure.

By mistake, patient 103165 from LIBREXIA 70033093ACS3003 trial received Dolutegravir 50mg / Lamivudine 300 mg (open label IP from another, non-JNJ trial) while the patient from the other trial received blinded Milvexian 25mg/placebo kits (IP from LIBREXIA ACS3003) due to an error at the time of IP delivery to patients. 

This error was identified by the site on Friday 05JUL2024 and reported to IQVIA Monitor on the same day. Immediately after, the 2 PIs (from the affected clinical trials) were informed, and each PI contacted the patients involved giving instructions to stop taking the study medications.  Both patients confirmed they do not have any adverse events to report. Both patients visited the site on 08JUL2024 for a follow up assessment with investigator teams.  

The dosing error may have the potential to significantly impact the patient’s safety and subsequent participation in the 70033093ACS3003 trial.  

Patient 103165 met eligibility criteria and was randomized on 24 April 2024 to the Milvexian 25mg/Placebo regimen.  The IP dispensation error occurred during the Week 4 visit.

During the call the FDA noted that an initial report had been submitted directly to the Bioresearch Monitoring board on February 21, 2024, and a follow-up report was submitted on March 7, 2024. The FDA stated that the report described suspension of enrollment due to participant randomization at more than one site in the VAC52416BAC3001 study.

The FDA indicated there was an expectation that the sponsor would provide an update on the identified compliance issue with a detailed corrective/preventative action (CAPA) report and discussion on impact duplicate enrollment has had on the study which had not been received. 

The Sponsor was not made aware that Advarra, Inc. had submitted a report to the FDA. 

Janssen confirmed that as sponsor we are aware of the duplicate enrollment issue and several corrective actions have been taken to date.  The Clinical Leader gave a high-level overview of duplicate participants within the ExPEC9V studies and the actions the sponsor has taken to ensure participant safety and the integrity of study data. 

An investigation found 14 sites in the United States all located in Florida (out of the approximately 124 participating sites in the US) had continued to enroll duplicate participants after being notified of the duplicate participant issue in their region. The 14 Florida sites were initially paused to enrollment; however, it has been determined that those sites will be permanently closed.  A method of identifying duplicate participant was established for frequent monitoring  of duplicate enrollments in the study that will continue for the duration of the study.

Trigger for escalation: Potential misconduct occurred at site AR-10008/ Principal Investigator Mercedes Argentina Garcia, MD with possible impact to subject’s safety, rights, and data integrity. 


Background: 
Several non-compliance incidents have been identified at site AR-1008:
(1)	During a Site Monitoring Visit 05-06 August 2024, signatures that did not match listed personnel on the delegation log were observed on four lab requisition worksheets from July-August, warranting further investigation.
(2)	Decision was made to complete a Compliance Monitoring Visit (CMV) to further investigate. During the CMV on 09-10 September 2024, it was found that unblinded staff performed IV infusions that should have been performed by blinded individuals. 
(3)	During an Independent Drug Monitor (IDM) Visit on 14 September 2024, it was found that between November 2022 – January 2024, IP/Placebo preparations were not performed by an unblinded Pharmacist. The blinded Lab technician prepared IP/Placebo which goes against local regulations.  As per the regulation, if a staff member is blinded, they are not allowed to prepare IP/Placebo and perform in an unblinded role.  As a result, blinding was compromised. 


Currently, there are 7 patients enrolled at this site. One patient discontinued treatment at week 44 on 27Aug2024. During the next visit window (23 September 2024, week 48), there is lab work, but no IP/Placebo will be administered. Patient participation in the trial will end after weeks 52 and 58 are complete.


Impact:  

Patient safety may be at risk due to unauthorized personnel performing IV infusions. According to ANMAT Regulation 6677/10 and GCP Guidelines ICH-E6, only properly delegated and trained staff may perform such tasks. Non-compliance with these regulations, combined with insufficient Principal Investigator (PI) oversight and potential falsification of signatures, compromises both patient safety and data reliability. 

Through these findings to date, multiple site staff have been identified in potential misconduct through a lack of adherence to the Protocol, Site IP Manual, IPPI, Blinding Plan, and the site contract. 

It is also important to note that there are other JNJ trials (77242113PSO3002, CNTO1959PSA4002, CNTO1959UCO3004, 61186372NSC2007) at this site. 

The Clinical team, Clinical Risk Management, and CAPA team were notified of this issue on 12 August 2024. A Quality Investigation (NC -19050) was initiated to document the issue. A decision was made to conduct a compliance monitoring visit (CMV) at the site which was performed on 09-10September 2024.  

The suspected issues were reviewed at the CMV, and this outcome was shared with clinical operations team on Thursday, 12 September2024. The local team will determine further action with the QA Auditing team.  

As of 18 September2024, it was confirmed by Sr. Compliance Manager that trial activities for 80202135SLE2001 (JASMINE), CNTO1959PSA4002 (STAR), 772421133002PSO (ICONIC), CNTO1959UCO3004 (ASTRO) will continue with an increased frequency of monitoring visits, until next steps are decided by the study team and support staff. 
For trial 61186372NSC2007 (COCOON), the Principal Investigator was informed to put enrollment on hold as per local recommendation and IQVIA Librexia was informed.

- Significant volume (1417) of missed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) for submission to Ugandan Health Authority (HA).

On 17-May-2024, during the bi-annual review of distribution rules (DR) for Uganda, the Local Safety Specialist noted the requirement to submit foreign solicited post marketed study reports. Reporting was set only for spontaneous reports and excluded solicited reports  A retrospective review of the DR was performed from the date the guideline was published and the results were received on 13-Aug-2024.  The DR should have been created when the guideline was initially implemented in 2018.

This is a nonconformance to TV-SOP-06663 v24.0 (Requirements for Set Up and Maintenance of Global Outbound Reporting System Distribution Rules) and TV-SOP-05428 v11.0 (Notification, Assessment, and Implementation of Changes in Pharmacovigilance Regulatory Requirements.

The retro review was assessed for reportable cases and on 26-Sep-2024, it was confirmed that 1417 would be reportable.  The escalation lead was made aware on 26-Sep-2024.

The late submission of solicited cases will impact regulatory compliance due to the significant volume of underreporting of foreign solicited ICSRs to the Ugandan Health Authority.

At this time there is no significant patient impact as all cases are in the Safety system and have been included in all signaling processes.   

At this stage there is no impact to business partners or to other areas of the business.

Investigation still ongoing on whether other studies were affected.

The site staff who are also EC members are sub-investigators in all identified cases, except one decision that contains PI signature. Delegated site staff signature has been identified in 41 EC decision letters and there is no initial approval among these letters. Identified letters were issued as approvals mainly for study documents such as protocols, ICFs, other subject-facing documents and site staff delegations. All approvals have sufficient number of signatures to remain valid when the delegated site member signature is excluded and also all those decisions were reviewed and approved by Health Authority. Date of affected approvals start from 2021 until 2024. The issue has been identified during a self-initiated review.

The EC noted that the members having study responsibility do not attend discussions and voting  for studies they are involved in, however, all decisions are signed by EC members collectively on same day so there is no documentation that currently verifies this process.

It is believed that this is a singular event, not a systemic or repeated error.  The impact of the issue is potentially to patient safety, patient rights, regulatory compliance.   The impact may include: 
-	Compromised sterility of the disposable syringe filter used after its date of expiry: This may result in inoculating microorganisms into the eye and developing an intraocular infection post-surgery / subretinal IP injection within several days. 
-	Compromised filtering ability of the disposable syringe filter used after its date of expiry. This may result in particles bigger than 0.45 um entering the eye and the subretinal space. Some filter pores close and increase shear stress during prep – potential for drug product aggregation/adsorption/loss of activity.
-	Filter integrity is highly compromised and pieces of the filter break off and are delivered to the patient as particulate matter (more likely with very old filters)

•	Lack of dissemination of safety information with key site personnel

Summary of Key issues

There were examples of incomplete or missing source documentation relating to Serious Adverse Events (SAE). These included incomplete investigator assessment of whether the SAE was drug related, whether the study drug required interruption, lack of grading of the event, missing information on seriousness and causality. 
The auditor established that information relating to SAE was entered into the eCRF by the study coordinator in the absence of any source documentation.

Recurrent issues were identified with source documentation management that impacted on transparency of information related to laboratory report assessments, IP administration and eligibility criteria.

The process of safety information acknowledgements with other Sub-Investigators (SI) was not documented.

In light of new information regarding the evaluated site’s performance over the past few weeks, study team [collaboration of the Central Team (TDL, TDM) and the local team (Compliance, Legal, GCO local team)], reached a mutual decision to terminate the site CB4-PL00015, 77242113PSO3004 on 06Mar2025.

On February 27, 2025, during a telephone conversation with the newly assigned Sub-Investigator (SI) at the mentioned site, LTM learned that the SI has limited knowledge about the study. SI also denied signing any documents referenced by LTM (Delegation Log, CV, and FDF), which were provided to the sponsor by the Site Director. The SI subsequently confirmed her statements via email. As in previous situation, local study team are unable to ascertain the accuracy of the information provided by the site.   

As no new impact has been identified, an additional escalation was determined as not required. However, investigation is ongoing, and if investigation reveals new impactful information, this issue will be re-evaluated.


Issue escalated on 21Jan2025. 
There is falsification of clinical trial monitoring visit reports for trial 77242113PSO3004, Poland site CB4-PL-10015.

On 21Nov2024, the SM (FTE), received an email from PI informing her that due to her health, she was compelled to resign from the position of PI. The PI proposed that the actively involved SI take over the role, and indicated that she had been actively involved since the start of the trial. PI responded 22Nov2024 via SMS text that she had resigned in Feb 2024. During co-monitoring visits  on 12 & 17Dec2024, site staff affirmed that the PI did not attend the SIV on 27Mar2024,   nor any other visits related to patient screening and enrollment.  This led to NC creation for lack of PI oversight (NC029237). During NC investigation, it was identified that two different SMs (one FTE, one Flex) falsely documented PI presence on four MVRs from SIV (27Mar2024) through August. 
One study and 1 site confirmed impacted, 77242113PSO3004, site PL-10015 which has 14 enrolled subjects. We can confirm the SMs were assigned to 77242113PSO3002, 3003 & 3004. It is possible the SMs were assigned to sites that didn’t enroll. Investigation is in progress regarding impact to other sites/trials.

On 01 MAY 2023, Israel GCO management decided to discontinue enrollment of new subjects by PI Prof. Peled Nir (Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Israel), due to growing GCO concern on protocol non-conformance and deviation from GCP requirements in trials active under this PI, with potential impact to patient safety and data integrity.

Factors leading up to this decision are summarized below:

Accumulation of different major protocol deviations and major site issues across active Janssen trials at the site, as noted per sponsor monitoring actions in 1Q2023. In the 3 trials recruiting new subjects in 1Q2023 under this PI, 3 of the 5 enrolled subjects were ineligible. Other issues and deviations identified in 1Q2023 include late SAE reporting, incorrect premedication administration, loss of source documents, use of unqualified site staff, and incorrect ICF version use.
Concern increased after a death case in an ineligible subject shortly after start of treatment in MARIPOSA-2 in March 2023, and Israel MOH question on this case on 06 APR 2023.

On 17 APR 2023, local GCO management reviewed the site status per 1Q2023 insight, and decided to meet with the PI to discuss a remediation plan to ensure compliance in the 2 ongoing trials and the 2 new trials opened in 1Q2023. A meeting with Prof. Peled was held as part of an on-site visit dated 27 APR 2023 and included the following Janssen representatives: Country Head, Clinical Research Manager (CRM) and Local Trial Managers (LTMs). 

On 01 MAY 2023, a local assessment team (including Country Head, CRM, LTMs and Compliance Team) convened to discuss continued PI performance concern after the on-site visit. It was determined that this non-conformance required sponsor action and creation of Quality Investigation record within TrackWise system. To prevent further potential impact in the 4 open trials, it was decided to terminate enrollment for all applicable studies under this PI. A formal letter was issued on 01 MAY 2023 to the Principal Investigator and IEC chairman with this decision made by the company.

The impacted trials and concerns per trial include the following:

61186372NSC3002 (MARIPOSA 2) 
Site enrolled 2 subjects of which 1 is ongoing (trial n=690).
• 1 Major Protocol Deviations: the PI enrolled 1 ineligible patient, who died shortly after start of treatment. Question was raised by the Israeli MoH about this case. Subject 320918 suffered a fatal event (atrial fibrillation, non-drug-related) on trial.  The subject had several medical conditions that would have potentially excluded them from enrolling in this trial.  
• 3 Major Site Issues: missing source data (ECG), reconsenting issue, and late reporting of an SAE.  
• 25 minor Protocol Deviations were identified. 

61186372NSC3004 (PALOMA 3) 
Site enrolled 3 subjects of which 1 is ongoing (trial n=400).
• 5 Major Protocol Deviations: the PI enrolled 2 ineligible patients; the same 2 patients were incorrectly administered pre medication dosing.  
• 3 Major Site Issues including a Sub Investigator conducting visits without IEC approval, and late SAE reporting. 
• 7 minor PDs. 
	
61186372NSC2002 (PALOMA 2)

During an on-site monitoring visit for 64091742PCR3001 (Magnitude) on 23Nov2022, Site Manager noted a difference between initial ICF signature and re-consent signature for 2 patients.  Review of ICFs for 67652000PCR3002 (Amplitude) at the same site revealed discrepancies on ICFs for 10 pre-screened patients.

Why is it important 
There is a risk that patients were not re-consented appropriately before enrolling in the studies. Additionally, misconduct related to consenting of study patients calls into question the validity of all data generated at this site.

What actions are being taken to address the situation 
Upon identification of the issues for Magnitude, the local team conducted a review of Amplitude ICFs and found issues with ICF documents for 10 pre-screened patients. 
In total 12 patients across the 2 studies are affected (64 ICF documents).  In Hungary ICF process requires the patient to sign 2 documents for each consent occasion (one subject information and one corresponding consent form) and there are 2 copies of each of these documents signed.
A QI was opened on 07Dec2022 for the issues noted for Magnitude.  Amplitude was added to the scope of the QI on 14Dec2022.
A visit to the site by the Amplitude LTM is planned on 19Dec2022 to investigate the matter further. 
The issue has been discussed with the PI and she has confirmed that one study coordinator admitted that he was responsible for the fraudulent activity, and he left the site in November 2022. The study coordinator was not delegated to perform consent procedures on the delegation log. 
For Magnitude, there was a 6-month period between February and July 2021 when these nonconformances occurred and for Amplitude it was July 2021 to February 2022. During this time, limited on-site monitoring was possible due to COVID-19.
A meeting was held with the central study teams of both studies, local team, Quality & Compliance EMEA and QP&S on 16Dec2022 and the team agreed to escalate SQI and to request a for-cause audit. During this meeting the team also discussed that the site is open for recruitment into Amplitude. As the issues relate to a study coordinator that has left the site, the team agreed that it was not necessary to put the site on hold for recruitment.

As part of the follow up review of Dr. Starkey’s decision to inactivate his medical license, new information was shared with Janssen in July 2022, indicating Dr. Starkey’s medical license was under probation as of January 2021 and had a previous temporary suspension to his license in 2010, which was not known to the Sponsor at the time of PI qualification.   A Janssen investigation into the site qualification process with the Synexus and IQVIA is underway (QI 2147159), including medical or specific disease area related training to oversee RSV vaccine trials.      

Additional background and information:  There have been 2 subjects screened with 2 randomized for VAC18193RSV3001 and 102 subjects screened with 75 randomized for VAC18193RSV2001. There are no remaining patient visits for either trial, and the site is pending final close out procedures.  

Dr. Starkey became the PI for VAC18193RSV2001 in June 2021, taking over from the initial PI at the Institution.  Dr. Starkey was also PI for VAC18193RSV3001 since Aug 2021. Additional information became known to the Sponsor on 13 July 2022 of Dr. Starkey’s previous infractions leading to suspension/probation of his medical license.   Further review of contractual language with Synexus indicates  departure from site qualification process as per terms of the agreement and a self-identified Quality Issue was opened on 27 July.  The escalation criteria regarding potential to result in significant compliance risks was determined and a significant quality issue was entered on 28 July.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2022-07-29 02:11:15.000,"NIZNIK, MICHELLE","•	Assessment of a QA audit or on-site quality monitoring visit by the Sponsor for both trials at the site

Patient 100148 was scheduled to receive talquetamab 135 µg/kg for Cycle 9 Day 15 treatment on 31-May-2022. IWRS was unable to issue a vial number for the registered visit, because no vials of talquetamab were available at the site, based on the inventory in IWRS.  However, 5 vials of talquetamab, which had previously been allocated to other patients but not used due to treatment holds, were at site. No DCFs were completed, therefore these vials didn’t show up in IWRS as vials being available to assign.
The automatic resupply function in IWRS was switched off in February 2022 (for all sites participating in TRIMM-2) as it was miscalculating the number of vials needed and triggering large quantities of drug to be sent to sites, which they were unable to store.  

On the day of the error, the pharmacy received guidance from the site monitor to select talquetamab vials with the highest vial number since IWRS had not issued a vial number. A vial number was not communicated. The highest vial number selected by the pharmacy for reconstitution contained teclistamab, and this mistake was not discovered during the reconstitution process. The prepared injection contained teclistamab but was labelled as talquetamab, therefore the nurse was not able to detect the error and the patient received erroneously 135 µg/kg teclistamab (total dose 10,989 mg) instead of talquetamab. 

The pharmacy had informed the monitor on 1-June-2022 at 12:40 pm. about the error. The patient was called immediately to ask him about his condition. The patient reported fever (up to 38.4°C), chills and decreased well-being since about 10 pm of 1-Jun-2022. He had taken paracetamol (500 mg 31.5.2022 around 10 pm and on 01.0622 at around 4 am). Patient was asked to take 1 mg paracetamol again and to find a transport to the clinic. Upon arrival his temperature was 37.9 °C, his well-being had already improved after paracetamol, he was in a stable condition with regard to vital signs. The symptoms were evaluated as a CRS grade I and for safety reasons patient was hospitalized. The hospitalization was reported as an SAE.
Patient was discharged after 72 hours (>24 hours fever free and no other concerning symptoms). Patient was treated for G1 CRS with fever/chills, received paracetamol, tocilizumab x1 and antibiotics. Patient skipped one week dose of talquetamab and resumed the week after (resulting in 2 week delay due to accidental exposure).

On 02June2022 QEM record was opened in Trackwise (record ID 2125092). On 28th June2022 the SRP provided full information on the SAE reported (CIOMS report) and confirmed that there was a risk to the patient as a result of this error and the hospitalization was not purely for pre-caution/ observation.

On 1-Jun-2022 the same dispensing issue occurred again (as new supplies of talquetamab had not yet arrived to address the site inventory issue) whilst preparing drug for patient 100144.  While again selecting the vial with the next highest number, the pharmacy staff selected a teclistamab vial instead of a talquetamab vial.  In this case, the mistake was identified immediately and did not lead to a dosing error.

This is the second time teclistamab was used instead of talquetamab, or vice versa in the 64407564MMY1002 (TRIMM-2 study) – prior case escalated on 01 February 2022 (refer to REACT record 2074617).",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2022-06-30 18:11:07.000,"Ratingen, Anja van","-The pharmacy will evaluate the incidence within their quality assurance system and will discuss further risk mitigation for such situations.

There is also a potential impact to data integrity with unblinded documentation being filed in the blinded ISF and study personnel possibly conducting both blinded and unblinded study tasks.

Background:
On 14-Mar-2023, the blinded CRA identified unblinded forms which indicated treatment assignments of 3 subjects filed in the blinded Investigator Site File (ISF). Upon further investigation, it was determined the unblinded pharmacist who is a non-licensed professional, was preparing Investigational Product (IP) (unblinded study task) and possibly administering IP (blinded task). 

Actions taken:
• On March 14, 2023, the blinded CRA was informed to stop reviewing the unblinded documents and to have the unblinded personnel return these documents to the unblinded files.
• Initially ICON classified this noncompliance as Quality Event (QE-096429) with a severity rating of minor and updated Janssen team on of their decision on 10-Apr-2023.
• The ICON team conducted a more robust investigation and informed the Janssen IDM on 05-May-2023 the unblinded pharmacist was both preparing the IP (unblinded task) and administering the IP (blinded task) since the first patient was dosed. The unblinded pharmacist was not delegated to perform the study task of administering IP.
 The site was then placed on a screening hold on 09-May-2023.
• On 15-May-2023, a meeting occurred with Janssen and ICON representatives and the PI. The PI confirmed this unblinded pharmacist is a medical assistant who is non-licensed and was preparing IP.

	M3 (critical finding – (site and sponsor) 27OCT2021
	
The following deficiencies were identified regarding GCP compliance of patient record documentation (source data documentation) recorded in the clinical site electronic health record system (ALBIS):

Lack of audit trail, non-compliance with ALCOA principles 
1. The electronic patient record, which was initially defined as a medium for recording source data, is not technically suitable for ensuring the traceability of entries: An audit trail is not available. Changed entries are provided with a current time stamp, but the nature of the change is not apparent. Furthermore, it is possible to delete entries completely. A log file generated by the system, which stores accesses to records, is overwritten by the system on a quarterly basis. The integrity of the data stored in the electronic file was thus negatively affected in that any modifications and deletions are not clearly represented. This is particularly relevant for data that was subsequently printed after the facts described in deficiency D2 became known.

Inadequate or missing verification of the suitability of the conditions and processes at the study site with regard to the source data documentation.
2.	The information provided by the study site to the sponsor regarding the technical conditions (survey using the Electronic Source Data Compliance Assessment Questionnaire) was repeatedly incorrect, even after the conditions described in item 1 and in deficiency D2 became known.
3.	Formally, the electronic patient record is still defined in the document ""Source Document Identification and Agreement"" is still defined as an electronic medium for source data, even if it was newly created on August 20, 2019. This is also supported by the fact that an additional ""Electronic Source Data Compliance Assessment Questionnaire"" was completed, which according to the form is only required if an electronic system is used as the source data medium.
4.	There is a lack of specifications regarding the frequency and type of printouts of the electronic file to ensure that changes are mapped or that the ALCOA principles are fulfilled.
5.	It is unclear why the present systems were accepted by the sponsor. An initial check of the information provided by the study site is not evident.

Noted by the inspector in the final report: The critical identified at the time of the inspection is unlikely to impact patient safety, but is systematic with respect to the conduct of the clinical study at the site. The deficiency did not affect the approval of the clinical study, but it did negatively affect the validity and trustworthiness of the data collected (procedures for implementing electronic systems and their documented validation).  The data entered into the ALBIS system is printed and stored in patient binders. The inspector reviewed two of the seven printed patient files against the clinical site electronic data base (ALBIS) and the inspectors were provided access to the eCRF and did not reveal any apparent discrepancies

Bioresearch Quality Assurance (BRQA) conducted a routine onsite Clinical Investigator Site Audit of Dr. Joseph Gathe, protocol TMC114FD2HTX4004, site Q94-US10001. The audit was performed in Houston, TX on 20-21 April 2022. The auditor noted significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on inadequate source documentation and a lack of Principal Investigator (PI) oversight to ensure the study was performed in a manner compliant with GCP and protocol requirements. 


Background
The Study TMC114FD2HTX4004 is a phase 4 study, to assess the change in body weight when switching to darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) (Immediate Switch Arm) compared to continuing the current integrase (INI) + tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC) antiretroviral (ARV) regimen (Delayed Switch Arm) in virologically-suppressed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected participants.

The audited Site Q94-US10001 has screened 12 participants starting August 7, 2020, and has enrolled 8 participants. The Principal Investigator confirmed that all the study subjects were recruited from his clinical practice with an Electronic Medical Record system in use.

Issue description 
Source documentation supporting patient eligibility for the study was inadequate/insufficient. 
As noted during the audit, the source documentation generated by the investigator site to support patient eligibility consisted of study-specific source worksheets and printouts of the eCRF system from a GILEAD study, for which, 3 out of 8 subjects were previously enrolled. 
The eCRF printouts were used by the site to support study data entries as described in the inclusion criteria for change in weight, namely vital signs at various time points. The eCRF printouts were anonymized with no evidence to confirm the subject identity. These eCRF records have not been Source Document Verified (SDV) by the Janssen Site Manager against the original source documentation.   

The study-specific source worksheets were completed by the Study Coordinator with no documented review by the Principal Investigator (PI) apart from physical exams. Moreover, the inclusion criteria stated that subjects should have documented evidence of virological suppression for 2-12 months prior to screening. For the 8 recruited subjects, there were no laboratory reports supporting virologically-suppression (Study Inclusion Criterion 5) upon enrollment. During the audit, the PI confirmed verbally that the details were housed in his electronic medical record (EMR). 
Although requested during the audit, access to the EMR was not granted by the Principal Investigator and certified printouts from the EMR were not provided. The PI stated that the eMR system was for clinical purposes only as it contains confidential information and cannot be accessed by the Sponsor representatives for clinical research purposes. 
ICH GCP 4.9.7 Upon request of the monitor, auditor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory authority, the investigator/institution should make available for direct access all requested trial related records.

In addition, no documentation could be found to support the investigator’s assessment of the Adverse Events causality and relationship to IP. The AE logs were completed by the study coordinators and not systematically reviewed by the PI (3/8 subjects).  
The source documentation issues were not identified during the routine monitoring visits. Therefore, adequacy and extent of the monitoring cannot be assured. During the audit, the current site manager did ask the site to write a note-to-file to clarify how the patient medical history was obtained.   

This data integrity/reliability issue represents a risk potentially limiting the data’s use. This risk may be mitigated by follow-up/re-monitoring of the site as discussed post-audit with the Sponsor’s representatives.

This Clinical Trial Unit is a private site, running multiple clinical studies. The site is located in Třída Míru/Pardubice - Czech Republic. 
This GCP Inspection was not specific to a clinical study but focused on the site’s processes and organization.  The J&J sponsored-study CNTO1959PSA3004 (Phase 3b, Guselkumab - Active Psoriatic Arthritis), monitored by the CRO Parexel was selected by the Inspectors, among 7 other studies (different sponsors).

At the time of the inspection, for the study CNTO1959PSA3004, there were 2 Screening Failures Subject and 1 Subject in screening.

Issue background and description:

On 22 Dec 2021, the Drug Safety Surveillance (DSS) Canada Local Safety Unit (LSU) submitted a ticket to the Global Medical Safety (GMS) Support Desk, to investigate an unexpected decrease in ICSR case volume from their Outbound Submission Tracking (OST) inbox.  Following assessment by Aris Global (the Global Safety System IT vendor), it was confirmed that a technical issue had occurred with the distribution rules (DRs). A Quality Issue (2066099) was subsequently opened on 7 Jan 2022 to investigate. Preliminary impact determined by the Safety Reporting group on 14 Jan 2022 identified in excess of 1,543 potentially missed ICSRs, from a retrospective review (covering 18 Dec 2021 - 30 Dec 2021), with multiple DRs impacted. Escalation lead was subsequently notified. 

A fix was applied to the production environment on 31 Dec 2021 to ensure the DR logic was fixed, with monitoring in place to ensure submissions are being generated as expected.

Preliminary cause is attributed to inadequacy in the IT DR Design specification and unit testing by the vendor.

The total number of impacted DRs and overall number of missed submissions is TBD. Aris Global are investigating and a team has been convened to determine the total number of missed submissions and identify root cause. In addition to the HC impact, the DR issue has been provisionally determined to impact MHRA reporting of seven Consumer cases. 

There is no impact on patient safety as the cases are in the safety database and included in routine safety signal detection activities. However, impact on regulatory compliance will be significant based on the provisional numbers.

However, the recommendation provided to the Sponsor Committee by the IDMC on 21Mar22 was to stop the study (no reason specified). The recruitment was then stopped, and patients continued in double blind phase potentially delaying their transition to open label treatment.

The AC-077A301 (A DUE) trial Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) completed their review of the Interim Analysis (IA) data in March 2022 with recommendation to stop the study per the blinded IDMC meeting report.  In review of communications from March 2022 between the IDMC and the SC the understanding of this recommendation was that the study was to stop recruitment of new patients and complete the final planned analysis; however, upon review of the closed session meeting minutes in November 2022 the IDMC had recommended to stop the study due to efficacy - which was not done.  

The IDMC had a regular meeting in May 2022 where a written recommendation was provided to continue study unmodified until next scheduled meeting.

The study is blinded, and it is not confirmed which subjects received active IP or placebo IP.  

Active IP to be stored at 02-08 C was not monitored for temperature between 02 May to 26 May 2022.  There were 14 subjects dosed with active IP or Placebo within this timeframe.  During a routine check by the site staff, it was noticed the electronic temperature monitoring system (probe) had malfunctioned and gone offline in the refrigerator containing active IP.  There were no power failures or malfunctions of the refrigerator.   In addition, temperature of placebo IP in an ambient storage area has not been monitored since the start of the trial.  Overall, there have been no previous storage temperature excursions reported by the site.   A quality investigation has been initiated by the site management CRO, IQVIA (QI 616427).   

On 24 June, Janssen Temperature Management concluded that no impact towards product quality is expected for IP stored in the refrigerator or in ambient storage area where temperature monitoring was not conducted.  

14 participants may have been dosed with the active IP within the window when the IP was not monitored in the refrigerator.  A review conducted by Janssen’s Study Responsible Physician indicated there are no adverse events or early withdrawals reported for these participants and there is no safety concern based on current data.   

On 23 June, the site contacted the sponsor to address 2 inquiries from the MHRA.

Several incorrect doses were administered to a patient due to body weight calculations not being performed as required

On 09Jun2022 the Site Manager identified that incorrect doses were administered for patient 200038 at site NL10003/MUMC/Dr. van Elssen. This was detected by noting discrepancies in the pharmacy and site source documentation. During that review it was identified that an incorrect body weight was used when calculating the dose (65kg instead of 57kg) on C1D1 (Step-up dose 1), C1D4 (Step-up dose 2), C1D8 (Step-up dose 3) and C1D15 (treatment dose). The overdoses for this patient are summarized below:
SU dose #01 administered on 29Apr2022: expected dose to be administered was 0,57mg, administered dose was 0,64 (total of 12,3% overdose).
SU dose #02 administered on 02May2022; expected dose to be administered was 3,4mg, administered dose was 3,9mg (total of 14,7% overdose).
SU dose #03 administered on 06May2022: expected dose to be administered was 17,1mg, administered dose was 20mg (total of 16,9% overdose).
C1D15 (treatment dose) was administered on 13May2022: expected dose to be administered was 34,2mg, administered dose was 40mg (total of 17% overdose). 

During investigation of the overdose errors it was also discovered that noncompliance with IPPI in regards to the incorrect use of needle size used for IP preparation may have also occurred. This may have additional impact on the dose levels identified (however impact is expected to be minor). 

Scope of the issue is limited to patient 200038 at site NL10003 in trial 64407564MMY1004. 
Two CRS events have been reported for this patient:
- Gr 1 CRS observed 03-06 May 2022
- Gr 1 CRS observed 12-14 Jun 2022

As per the Study Responsible Physician: the patient experienced Gr1 CRS after the 2nd step-up dose.

This study is monitored by IQVIA.

The audit confirmed the falsification of e-diary information for at least 8 subjects (132 subjects enrolled at the site).  
The e-diaries were completed by a study staff member (a student, not medically qualified, employed as an Administrative Assistant) and not by the study participants or their caregivers.  The Administrative Assistant recorded the data using the participants’ credentials and, the e-devices (phones) initially provided to the participants but returned to the site.  The participants’ credentials were noted on back on the devices (sticky notes) according to the Study Coordinator, interviewed during the audit. 
 
The falsified entries for those 8 subjects were recorded with different devices at unexpected times (during the night) and a few seconds/minutes apart. For the falsified entries, there was no documentation supporting direct contact/communication between the Administrative Assistant and the participants. 

The Principal Investigator indicated that he only became aware of this issue recently (mid-SEP2021) and confirmed that the data were recorded by the Administrative Assistant. The Principal Investigator stated that the Administrative Assistant acted on his own initiative. As the Assistant was not available during the audit, this statement could not be corroborated. According to the PI and the Study Coordinator, the assistant is still employed by the site.

The Principal Investigator stated that there were regular medical follow-up contacts with these participants (contacts with family, relatives or friends). No source documentation was available to support those regular contacts and the medical follow-up. It was confirmed that the ediaries specific questions were not asked/answered twice a week in contradiction with the Study Protocol. 

Additional data integrity/data privacy concerns were identified during the audit which will be included in the audit report.

However, instead the study nurse administered talquetamab (54mg, 0.6mg/Kg) by mistake. Talquetamab is part of a pre-approval access program 64407564MMY4002 in Finland for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  

Impact:
The participant was immediately hospitalized as a precaution for observation and monitoring of potential Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS**), Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS***) and neurotoxicity. The participant was administered  dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, acetaminophen and tocilizumab to prevent potential CRS. In addition, the participant received additional dexamethasone and cetirizine (see below).The participant was discharged from hospital (when considered stable by the PI) on 22May23. 

No other participants received an incorrect drug/dose (the unused Velcade was destroyed and a new talquetamab was prepared for the pre-approval access participant).
This was a major protocol deviation and met withdrawal criteria for the CARTITUDE 5 study.
One other participant is ongoing at the site for the CARTITUDE 5 study. Further investigational product scheduled for this participant consists only of PO administration of Rd (Prior Velcade administrations were completed correctly). 
Prior to this incident the site has had good quality in their work and compliance with the protocol etc. for the first 2 subjects

Initial root cause is that there was a mix up between a syringe prepared for this participant for Velcade and another syringe prepared for a pre-approval access participant for talquetamab. The study nurse indicated that she did not check the participant names/numbers properly against the syringe label before administering the dose. 

SAE further details: While hospitalized, on the evening of May 19th the participant had a drop in blood pressure (80/54), felt weakness and was administered IV fluids, dexamethasone 20mg x 2 days and cetirizine 10mg PO x 2 days for CRS prophylaxis. Blood pressure subsequently normalized. The participant did not have any other symptoms of CRS however they were receiving paracetamol that could have masked any fever.  No neurotoxicity was experienced.

Notes:
*VRd is the regimen of Bortezomib (Velcade), Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone.
** Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) is a condition that can occur after treatment of a fast-growing cancer, especially certain leukemias and lymphomas (cancers of the blood). As tumor cells die, they break apart and release their contents into the blood. This causes a change in certain chemicals in the blood, which may cause damage to organs, including the kidneys, heart, and liver.
***Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction that is associated with immunotherapy, such as talquetamab

Public Health England, which is a governmental institute under UK Health Security Agency, informed approached  Janssen on 31-Mar-22 that this issue could result in a potential serious breach reporting event, according to PHE procedures.

Issue 
67 humoral samples to assess neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV 2 across 2 assays for the VAC31518COV2001 (COV2001) trial analyzed at Public Health England (PHE) were found to be invalid after the data was submitted to FDA and EMA. COV2001 Group 9 10 DAY 197 data became available in the form of Tables, Listings and Figures on 18 Jan 2022. Review of these data and comparison with the S-ELISA data identified unexpected results. Janssen requested for PHE to further investigate the incongruent data on 27 Jan 2022. On 16 Mar 2022 PHE informed Janssen via email of preliminary investigation results suggesting mishandling of data samples by lab operator. They opened a non-conformance in their system the next day after meeting with the Janssen team.

On 29 March 2022 PHE reported the results of their non-conformance investigation confirmed 67 samples across 14 plates conducted across 2 assays were invalidated due to incorrect handling by the lab operator and data previously uploaded to Janssen in June 2021 were inaccurate. Janssen requested a retest of all 67 samples the same day. 

Impact
The results of the 2 inaccurate assays were reported in multiple regulatory submissions including:

•	COV2001 TLR used for EMA and FDA booster applications: EDMS RIM 518007
•	ACO for FDA booster application: EDMS RIM 515644

Non-compliance with privacy protection of patient details used by World Courier in Direct-to-Patient Medical Product (DTP-MP) shipments to patient homes. 

Issue Background and Description:
World Courier inadvertently included patient-identifying information in various DTP-MP shipment data fields (consignee and delivery signature), to include patient name (first, last, initials, both) and/or address details. Per the COVID-19 exception process for DTP-MP shipment and the related contract with WorldCourier, these details should have been protected in records available to Janssen. 
Patient details became visible to Janssen or Janssen-contracted staff through two mechanisms.  
First, the shipment details are included in a shipment history report that Janssen staff (primarily CSC Logistics) could download from the World Courier online customer portal for DTP shipment metrics. CSC Logistics downloaded this report on a weekly basis and routinely only reviewed select columns (date, protocol, temperature, country) from this shipment report.  The report has more than 60 columns of shipment data and the Consignee and Delivery Signature fields were not reviewed until recently.  
Second, this patient information would be populated in the World Courier automated shipment notifications (pickup and delivery).  Per the COVID-19 DTP guidance document and the World Courier order email template, at least the Janssen LTM would be a recipient of the automated notifications.  

The issue occurred when World Courier manually populated the shipment data fields.  World Courier is supposed to only enter in confidential terms for patient information, such as “confidential” or “patient ID XXXXX”.  Due to human error, some patient information was directly populated.

This issue has occurred 203 times between Feb-2020 and Aug-2021 out of a total 1830 COVID-19 DTP shipments with World Courier during that time period.
Note that the issue is not fully resolved, and it is possible that additional events have happened since Aug-2021. 

World Courier opened an internal CAPA Record (CAPA_BRU_2021_OCT_001). Once this is confirmed as in place, another report will be needed for potential cases after August2021.   

Potential impact: 
Reporting to health authorities, site, and ECs/ IRBs will need to be considered at local level, as privacy laws and regulations differ. Privacy control confirmation was requested by several local site ECs in the roll-out of the Cov-19 DTP-MP exception process, and transparency in reporting non-compliance may need to be considered.  

Safety: No impact on patient safety 
Data Integrity:  No impact on data integrity. No risk of treatment unblinding, as the actual product in the DTP- MP shipment is not tracked or included in notifications.

Note: During the inspection the Inspector questioned Exclusion criteria #18 for subject 22700202:  Subject was diagnosed Peptic Ulcer Disease in 2012 and was using Pantoprazole since then to date.  PI responded that the subject did not complain of any flare up/symptoms and that he does not think that it was actually PUD as she was only seen by her GP and not a Gastroenterologist. PI said that he prescribes PPI’s often for his patients when they complain of any gastrointestinal discomfort, and he thinks that it could be symptom of stress.  Inspector said this will be a finding and advised the PI to confirm by discussing with the subject and documenting the discussion in the source file.  After the Exit meeting, by chance the subject came to the site, and she confirmed that it was actually just heartburn and she never has an ulcer as such.

Overdose error event which was considered an SAE due to required prolonged hospitalization for observation.

Step up dosing involves administration of one or more doses prior to a subsequent target dose. The step-up dose(s) are less than or equal to a dose that has been previously deemed safe by the Study Evaluation Team (SET). For this dosing error at site ES10005 (PI: Laura Rosinol Dachs) in Spain, the step up dose was missed and the patient received the full dose earlier than planned as the treatment schedule for this patient should have been as follows: 

C1D2 – SU#1 (13Apr2022)
C1D4 – SU#2 (15Apr2022)
C1D8 -  Full dose (19Apr2022)

The overdose happened as a new schedule was approved due to the Easter holidays and step-up #2 (SU#2) was delayed to C1D8 – on April 19th. By mistake the sub-I cancelled the C1D4 – SU#2 instead of delaying it to C1D8.  Subject 100299 was overdosed on 19Apr2022 since the full treatment dose was administered rather than SU#2 (100 mg instead of 15 mg).
 
This dosing error had a potential safety impact as step-up doses are given to mitigate Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). CRS is a complication that can happen due to the activation of immune cells and in a few events can be severe, life threatening, or even lead to death.

- Significant volume of missed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) submissions to US FDA

Issue background and description:

On 22-Apr-2022, an issue with the FDA spontaneous reporting rules was identified, whereby if negative causality was entered for either reporter or company causality, the case was erroneously suppressed from submission to FDA.  On 09-May-2022, Global Safety Reporting (GSR) requested 8 FDA spontaneous distribution rules (DRs) to be corrected through change control. Once the correction was made, spontaneous cases with negative causality were distributed appropriately to FDA.  A retrospective review was initiated for both Pharma and Consumer to identify any under reported cases from 17-Jun-2019 to 01-Jun-2022. 

On 16-Aug-2022, Compliance Strategy & Analytics (CSA) contacted GSR to investigate previously unreported case versions. Quality Investigation (2154259) is currently ongoing. The origin of the error impacting the DRs is still being determined through the root cause analysis as part of the ongoing investigation. Appropriate CAPAs will be developed accordingly. Correction will include retrospective submission of the missed ICSRs.

On 07-Sep-2022, the escalation lead was notified of the QI and confirmation provided that ~1,286 ICSRs would be classified as late to FDA.  On 08-Sep-2022, outcome from both retrospective reviews resulted in ~2,105* missed ICSRs (1302 Pharma and 803 Consumer). 

There is no impact to patient safety as the cases are in the safety database and included in routine safety signal detection activities. However, impact to regulatory compliance will be significant based on the potential number of missed submissions to FDA.

J&J GMSO retains the responsibility to provide Safety Reports to IQVIA Biotech CRO for their distribution to sites and local IRBs.  It was confirmed during a meeting between the J&J Study team and the IQVIA Biotech project management team on 29 JAN 2024, that IQVIA Biotech had not been receiving safety reports from the J&J Safety team. 

While we have an Alliance partnership with IQVIA, the ARN-509-001 trial was originally contracted with Novella.  Novella was acquired by IQVIA in 2013 and subsequently renamed IQVIA Biotech.  The ARN-509-001 trial is contracted under a Novella Master Service Agreement (MSA) which remains in effect until the conclusion of the ARN-509-001 Work Order.  The Project Outsourcing Manual (POM), applicable to the Alliance partnership, is not covered by the Novella MSA.  

Instead, IQVIA Biotech follow their SOPs, the relevant task ownership matrix as outlined in the contractual agreement between IQVIA Biotech and Janssen, and the IQVIA Biotech Safety Management Plan. 

IQVIA Biotech did not receive IND Safety reports/listings from Janssen through SafetyPortal or other relevant sources. Hence, IND safety reports/listings were not sent to the sites/PI by IQVIA Biotech since 12Feb2020 for submission to IRBs per IRB/site policies. 

The issue happened when J&J switched to SafetyPortal on 26 FEB 2020 from Intralinks safety database reporting. Prior to switching to SafetyPortal, safety reports were distributed via emails/Intralinks to IQVIA Biotech and IQVIA Biotech study/safety team, who then shared safety reports with the sites/PI.   In 2020, 4 sites were still open, and 6 patients were still on the study upon SafetyPortal implementation. 

A Clinical Trial Manager raised a SAM (Janssen’s service portal) ticket in 2022. Without access to the content of the ticket, the JnJ safety team eluded that the request was for instructions on how to retrieve the safety reports.  This Clinical Trial Manager had left the company without final resolution or informing the incoming CTM of pending action.  This was a contributing factor to the issue.  Also, the IQVIA Biotech Clinical Research Associate (CRA) who received SafetyPortal training and access at the end of 2022 went on medical leave (mid 2023) without appropriately transitioning this responsibility to the next IQVIA Team Member. 

In Oct2023 a JnJ CTM raised concerns regarding the Safety Management Plan scope for IND safety reporting since the instructions in the Safety Management Plan were not aligned with TV-SOP-07445: Distribution of Safety Reports in Clinical Studies to Investigators and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards (IECs/IRBs)

IQVIA Biotech did not raise the fact that they were not able to access safety reports to J&J from FEB 2020 to JAN 2024.    

Currently, in FEB 2024, there are 3 ongoing patients at two open sites.  Some PIs may have received safety reports from other Erleada studies using the same compound.  A SafetyPortal listing was generated by the JNJ Safety Team. There are 458 IND safety reports listed/reported for apalutamide from all studies since SafetyPortal was commissioned in Feb2020 till 30Jan2024. These were not reported to the sites/PI by ARN-509-001 IQVIA Biotech study team.

It is important to note that these patients have been on stable apalutamide treatment for many years. Most Adverse Events occur in the early stages of treatment and both the TITAN and SPARTAN studies showed that there was no increase in AE incidence as treatment duration increased.

Trigger for escalation:  Drug preparation and administration error, whereby Tocilizumab (concomitant medication) was given subcutaneously instead of Teclistamab (study medication) with potential serious breach reporting required.  Site GB10001: Royal Marsden Hospital, PI Boyd.  Patient has been informed of the error.

Background:
The Tocilizumab (Toci) formulation given to the patient 100029 at C10 on 03jan2023 was for intravenous (IV) use, not Subcutaneous (SC) use. The dose of Toci given to the patient was the same as the intended Teclistamab (Tec) dose (334mg) and not in line with the label requirements for Toci. The Teclistamab C10 dose was not administered on 03Jan2023 as planned. Another visit was scheduled on 05Jan2023 where Tec was administered delayed, but still within window.
On 03Jan2022, study IP prescription and pharmacy procedures were done correctly. Vial number was correctly assigned via IWRS. Tec was prescribed and dispensed from the pharmacy at the correct dose. At the site, Tocilizumab is stored in the fridge at the day unit in order to be available for Cytokine Release syndrome (CRS) reactions. The Toci was not labelled for patient 100129, however Toci was taken from the fridge by site staff, reconstituted at the Teclistamab dose, second checked by another nurse who also did not identify the drug error, and then administered to the patient.
The error was then noted when the Teclistamab arrived at the day unit from the aseptic pharmacy unit.

Patient impact
Per Study Responsible Physician (SRP) during the Serious Breach meeting on 06Jan2023 the impact to the patient is to be determined since the patient was neutropenic on 05Jan23. If the neutrophil count recovers and the patient has no infections while the neutrophil count is low, then there is no significant impact to patient safety. If the neutrophil count does not recover then there is a greater chance for risk of infection which constitutes a potential safety impact to the patient. The patient was administered delayed Teclistamab on 05Jan23 and given G-CSF while lenalidomide was held.

At the request of IGJ, a meeting was held on 27 June 2022 between Janssen representatives and IGJ GCP Inspectors to discuss the inspectors’ perspective that Janssen should have notified the IGJ (and other Health Authorities) and the Ethics Committees of the changes to dosing regimens through submission of a Substantial Amendment.  This is the second Health Authority to approach Janssen about modifications based on SET decisions.  The ANSM (France) posed questions and concerns to Janssen that were very similar to IGJ, starting in May.  These communications were initially escalated on 10 May 2022 (REACT TW record 2114985) and are ongoing.

Background:
A SUSAR (Gr4 multi organ failure) was reported in one cohort for this trial (Regimen A: talquetamab and carfilzomib) and submitted globally on 29 March 2022.  Based on recommendation of the talquetamab SMT, dosing with carfilzomib was  paused while a Study Evaluation Team (SET) meeting could be held.  The SET recommended reducing the dose of  carfilzomib and additional pre/post dose hydration and increased dose of dexamethasone to mitigate risk.  These changes  were implemented based on recommendations of the SET, as per the approved protocol.  Section 4.1.3 of the protocol provides the SET with broad responsibilities for monitoring treatment emergent data and making decisions to modify dose, change treatment or procedure schedules, and place temporary hold on enrolment for any parts of the study to ensure continued safety of participants enrolled in the study, with communications to investigators and regulatory authorities, as required.  Because these SET responsibilities were approved by all Health Authorities (including IGJ) prior to the start of the study, whereby changes to dose regimens by the SET were possible, Janssen did not submit these changes as a substantial amendment to the protocol prior to implementation/communication to investigators. 

The US FDA subsequently placed the trial on partial hold on 28 Apr 2022 to pause any further enrolment into all regimens including carfilzomib until safety information could be further assessed.  Enrolled patients were allowed to continue if reconsented.

The SMT determined on 4 May 2022 to extend the enrolment hold to all countries, and informed relevant Health Authorities through an Urgent Safety Measure (USM) notification on 6 May 2022.

The Netherlands Health Authority (IGJ) responded to the USM notification on 8 Jun 2022 with questions regarding Janssen’s prior actions to implement the dose reduction of carfilzomib and additional changes to pre/post dose mitigations.  In response to questions, Janssen provided relevant SMT and SET meeting minutes, and through review of those minutes, IGJ has noted other changes that were implemented based on SET recommendations (as specified in the approved protocol).

IGJ stated that any changes of this nature that are being taken to preserve or protect the health and well being of study subjects are, by nature, substantial amendments according to EU regulation.  The Janssen team has contended that the protocol provided for the ability for these types of changes to be made based solely on SET recommendation, and so an immediate substantial amendment was not viewed as required.  The inspectors have requested that Janssen submit a substantial amendment to address all changes implemented based on SET recommendations, and to copy them on the submission of the Substantial Amendment to IGJ and the Ethics Committee.  Assuming the submission does not raise further questions, they do not intend to take further actions at this time.

The issue was identified via a  routine remote monitoring visit (7-10June2021), and is related to human error by the site research coordinator in using an identical tablet from another sponsor instead of the Janssen tablet. 
In total, 15 PRO opportunities were missed – screening ePRO data was missed for all 8 impacted subjects. This data is not likely to be recovered per the study team so change from baseline will likely not be measurable for these 8 subjects. PRO data is being used for Secondary Endpoint analysis only.

Issue impact considered: 

Safety: No impact. The issue only impacts patient-reported outcome in the secondary analysis, and has no impact on primary safety data analysis or safety risk for subject treatment.  

Data Integrity: Minimal to no impact. The issue impacts ePRO baseline data for 8/11 subjects enrolled at site US10022 in MajesTEC-1 part 3. The team is not aware of any other sites who have made mistakes with a GSK or other sponsor tablet.
From statistical point of view, 8 subjects missing data will dilute the results. However, the study has over-enrolled (i.e., Phase 2 Cohort A planned to enroll 100 subjects and actually enrolled 110 subjects). Hence the potential statistical impact should be small. For primary analysis, only 1 of these 8 subjects would be impacted for PROs since the analysis set will be based on treatment start date and the other subjects were treated after the set date (18Mar2021 cut-off). 
Seven of the eight subjects with missing baseline PROs are African Americans (AA). The is no AA analysis planned at the moment. A future analysis may be of interest, and the impact could be substantial if there is an interest to evaluate PROs in AA subjects. 
The team will still explore if any of the data on the GSK tablet can be leveraged to Janssen data needs, which may be possible for 1 of the 3 ePRO questionnaires only. The GSK tablet has 5 questionnaires, while Janssen has 3. The only overlapping ePRO is “EORTC QLQ-C30: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core Module.” It’s still unknown which version of this questionnaire GSK is using, and if the data can be retrieved for Janssen use, possibly via a paper output and manual data entry.  
GSK has been informed on June 22, 2021  and the site will follow up with GSK to discuss how to proceed. 

Patient Rights/ Privacy: Minimal to no impact. The GSK ePRO questionnaires only include subject ID and year of birth. No other patient identifiers were collected. 
Site personnel plans on removing all relevant questionnaire data from the GSK tablet. Data collection in the GSK study is not active at this point, and no data was transmitted. GSK has not seen the data and deletion without remaining privacy impact is an option.
The site consulted their IRB and agreed there is no need to advise the patients involved of this situation as no PHI (Protected Health Information) or privacy was compromised.

On 12 SEP 2023 a regulatory manager, from ICON, submitted a letter to the health authority, ANMAT, in Argentina to notify them that three sites on the 17000139BLC3001 (SunRIse 2) study (outsourced study) did not fulfill the commitment letter’s requirement to conduct Tuberculosis Skin Testing at screening.  

Background: 
A Janssen QA site audit was conducted at site S71-AR10009 from 11 JUL – 18 JUL 2023.  The auditor discovered an ANMAT commitment letter signed by the PI, SRP, and GTL dated 26 JUL 2021.  The commitment had required the investigators to perform additional assessments that were not part of the protocol amendment 2 at the time. Protocol amendment 2 incorporated all the assessments listed on the commitment letter (i.e. pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening), except for TB Skin Test at Screening which is utilized to rule out Tuberculosis.  All SunRIse 2 sites located within Argentina must sign the ANMAT commitment letter.  Currently there are 10 sites open in Argentina.  The commitment letter requires additional assessments outside the protocol.  The implementation of a HA commitment letter should have triggered the study team to implement updates to study specific guidance documents and system updates for sites within Argentina (i.e, protocol amendment, monitoring guidelines, or eCRF) to ensure that sites were complying to the required additional assessments, specifically TB skin test at screening.  The other assessments required under the ANMAT commitment letter are covered within the protocol (i.e., pregnancy exams, HIV and HEP A and B at screening).  However, the TB skin test, was an assessment done outside of the protocol requirements.  TB Skin testing at screening is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3 which states Exclusion # 30 that “Must not have active tuberculosis.” The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis.  


ICON site management conducted reviews on all sites in Argentina because of this audit finding on Site S71-AR10009.  It was determined that 3 Sites out of 10 sites did not conduct the TB Screen testing at screening.  The following sites failed to conduct TB Skin Tests:  S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient.  

Site S71-AR10009 used a CT scan instead to assess for presence of Tuberculosis. TB Skin testing is not a requirement of the current protocol amendment 3, which states on Exclusion # 30, that “Must not have active tuberculosis.” The protocol does not require a specific assessment to rule out tuberculosis.  Investigators are expected to rely on patient reporting on active medical conditions, conduct further testing to rule out TB, and confirm absence of TB based on their clinical assessment.  

Impact: 
There were 3 sites that had not been following the MOH Commitment letter and failed to conduct TB Skin Tests:  S71-AR10010 enrolled 2 patients; Site S71-AR10009 enrolled 16 patients, and S71-AR10004 enrolled 1 patient.  

The SRP’s assessment (26 SEP 2023) of impact is there is no risk to patient safety if TB Skin test was not done.   Medical History, a complete Physical Exam, Hematology, Blood Chemistry, Urinalysis and CT/MRI scans with contrast of chest, abdomen, and
Pelvis were performed at screening which would indicate presence of active Tuberculosis.  

If a patient with active TB is enrolled in the study, there is a potential they may infect others. In addition, TB exacerbation has been observed in patients receiving PD-(L)-1 inhibitors as well as those receiving systemic chemotherapy. The above-mentioned screening exams are frequently repeated during conduct of the study and have very high sensitivity for detection of potential reactivation of latent TB.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2023-09-27 21:38:39.000,"Moya, Isabelle","•	Include country specific appendix for Argentina with the latest protocol Amendment 4 approval in Argentina is expected in OCT 2023

Trigger for Escalation:   AIFA (HA Italy) placed a conditional approval for the SunRIse trials, requesting a separate CIA (clinical investigation application) for the Urinary Placement Catheter (UPC) device, and requested a temporary enrollment hold on November 15th 2023.  

Background: The UPC is used for the intravesical placement of TAR-200 in the bladder. It does not have a CE mark and is a low-risk, Class I sterile device. The four SunRIse studies were designed to evaluate TAR-200 alone or in combination with cetrelimab and are not a clinical evaluation of the UPC to demonstrate conformity nor to evaluate or establish the performance, clinical benefit, or safety of the UPC. Therefore, per Article 62 (1) of the MDR, it was the opinion of the Sponsor at the time of trial design and start that a clinical investigation application to the health authority for this Class I sterile, low-risk device separate to the CTA application for the TAR-200 integral drug-device combination product was not warranted and confirmed with the Italian HA. 
  
AIFA has now communicated with the local team that the UPC device should have a Clinical Investigation Agreement (CIA) submitted for each study in order to resolve this issue.  AIFA asked to place a hold on enrolment for all SunRIse studies until the CIA is approved for use of the UPC device for SR 1, 2, 3, and 4 studies.   This impacts patients in screening (no ICF signed) by November 15th 2023, but patients on treatment can continue treatment.

The Sponsor acknowledges the understanding device-related requirements have evolved in the past years and has agreed to submit a separate CIA application as soon as possible.

A Notice of Regulatory Inquiry of concerns from ANSM was sent to Janssen, outlining concerns with the study modifications made on two trials. 

Brief/succinct summary of issue
This event is currently considered a potential Significant Quality Issue per TV-SOP-25014 as it represents a compliance issue with immediate and future potential to affect compliance with regulatory requirements of clinical trials, and the compliance status/reputation of the Business Unit.

On 27 April 2022, the sponsor received an urgent notification and request for information from ANSM related to the ongoing clinical studies, MajesTEC-2 (64007957MMY1004) for teclistamab; and MonumenTAL-2 (64407564MMY1004) for talquetamab. The reason for the inquiry was that conditions under which the relevant studies were approved no longer correspond to the conditions indicated in the respective authorization requests the agency received. 

Modifications to the treatment regimens for these two dose-finding studies were prompted by a routine Study Evaluation Team (SET) review of safety data, as described in the original protocols approved by ANSM.  These modifications were to withdraw/modify treatments considered part of the standard of care (withdrawal of bortezomib/dose reduction of carfilzomib) to reduce frequency of adverse events noted in patients in relevant cohorts, and had been made without:
-	informing the authorities about this change and the reason, 
-	immediately amending the protocols, 
-	obtaining approval from the Ethics Committee and/or Health Authorities prior to implementation. 

ANSM considers that both of these circumstances meet the definition of a ‘new fact’ in French regulation and that modifications should have been implemented according to procedures for Urgent Safety Measure defined in French/EU regulation, and that describing the process by which the SET will evaluate safety and make recommendations for modifications does not exempt the Sponsor from filing a request for authorization of modifications, per these regulations.  

In the request, ANSM communicated an intention to suspend the inclusions in France in arms B1 and B2 for the 64007957MMY1004 trial and arms A and B in the 64407564MMY1004 trial.  Additionally, the US FDA has placed arms A and B in 64407564MMY1004 on partial clinical hold as of April 28, 2022, pending further information on the adverse events and potential benefit/risk of the modified dose of carfilzomib in these regimens.  The study team is implementing an immediate pause of enrollment for these arms globally.

The response to ANSM was submitted on May 4, 2022.  Janssen is waiting for response and further discussion.  As this use of SET to determine dose modifications in dose finding studies is a common practice in Early Development Oncology, and new EU CTR regulations require harmonized submissions, ANSM opinion will have broader potential impact on future Janssen practice.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2022-05-06 19:00:49.000,"DALTON, PATRICK","The Study Evaluation Team (SET) has routinely been used in Oncology Phase 1 dose escalation studies to continuously review emerging safety data from patient cohorts and recommend changes to treatment regimen to manage dose limiting toxicities and ensure identification of optimal dose regimen. The SET is chaired by the sponsor’s Study Responsible Physician and membership includes principal investigators, sponsor clinical scientist(s), safety physician (sponsor’s Safety Management Team chair), statistician(s), clinical pharmacologist(s), and additional sponsor staff, as appropriate. The purpose of the SET has been described in study protocols submitted and approved by global Health Authorities.  Janssen has used the protocol to communicate its intent to make immediate changes to treatment regimens in these trials based on SET recommendations, and Janssen has considered Health Authority approval of the protocol as sufficient to do so.  This is the first instance where a Health Authority has objected to the practice that it considers to be noncompliant to regulations. 

The response to ANSM’s inquiry was submitted on 4 May 2022 as requested by the agency. Further discussion with ANSM or actions are anticipated after review of Janssen response.

In follow-up to the escalation of the significant quality issue #2167520 (Anonymously Reported Allegations of Quality and Data Integrity Issues with Janssen R&D’s Data at Signant Health), a GCP-focused QA audit of Signant Health was conducted, under the direction of the Law Department, on 17-26 October 2022. In addition to this audit, a cross-functional team was mobilized to conduct a detailed investigation under the direction of the Law Department.

The objectives of the audit were to evaluate the development, validation, implementation, maintenance, support, and oversight of the Signant Health Interactive Response Technology (IRT) & Electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA) systems, as well as the provider's Quality Management System (QMS).

This audit resulted in multiple significant audit observations including 1 Critical and 7 Major Observations.

The Critical observation was related to the inadequacies of the QMS, in particular:

-- the deficient investigation and resolution of serious compliance issues (never events, for example related to unblinding, dosing/randomizations errors…),
-- the insufficient quality assurance oversight,
-- the ineffective CAPA management, and,
-- the incomplete training/qualification program for the provider’s staff.

The Major observations highlighted deficiencies regarding the validation testing/documentation of key system functionalities, the cybersecurity & privacy frameworks, Business Continuity /Disaster Recovery, and the handover of operational responsibilities within Signant Health.

Numerous observations raised during this audit were repeat observations from the previous audit conducted (MAR2020 – Audit Reference ESP2020Q13527), confirming the insufficient mitigation actions implemented.

The management of the related action plans, including the development of Corrections and Corrective/Preventative Actions to address the Observations in the audit report, will adhere to the BRQC QA audit reporting processes.  This will require detailed investigations including an assessment of the impact to past and ongoing Janssen studies and will inform decision making on ongoing/future work.

Meetings with Janssen and Signant Health Leadership (Quality and Business) will be set up to share the significance and severity of the audit outcome and obtain commitment for urgent attention and action. 

The outcome of this audit will also be assessed for potential serious breach reporting.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2022-12-02 17:40:43.000,"Patel, Parul",Refer to Audit Id ESP2022Q36294.,No Subsequent Escalation,

Additional study- records were provided on 21OCT2021 to close the audit.

The audit confirmed significant non-compliances at the site resulting in a Critical Observation focused on lack of Principal Investigator (PI) oversight to ensure the study was performed in a manner compliant with GCP and protocol requirements.  

A summary of the significant non-compliances (reported as major observations) that reflect the lack of PI oversight include:

1.	Study tasks were performed by clinical staff members that were not qualified and/or delegated to perform them, including consenting and reconsenting, assessment of post-vaccination reactions, randomization of subjects, prescribing Investigational Product (IP) and updating of study delegation log.
2.	The clinical site executed an inadequate consent process, including using non-IRB approved subject-facing material. In addition, several issues were identified with regards to documentation of the consent process. 
3.	The Principal Investigator (PI) demonstrated a lack of awareness about ongoing issues at the site
4.	There was minimal documentation of PI oversight in the source documents

A study participant (TR10006-0002) in the Phase 2b Geographic Atrophy (GA) 81201887MDG2001 trial received either the IP or a sham procedure in the ineligible eye.  As part of the eligibility process, the central reading vendor (Boston Imaging Reading Center - BIRC) provides an eligibility confirmation form to the study site (based on images submitted by the site).  While both eyes had GA, the area of the GA lesion in the right eye was smaller than the inclusion criteria and was thus deemed ineligible.  The area of the GA lesion in the left eye met the inclusion criteria and was thus deemed eligible. 

On 21Nov2023 (Day 1), the masked study coordinator (SC) incorrectly transcribed the information from the BIRC eligibility form into IWRS and indicated the right (ineligible) eye was to have the study procedure.   The unmasked administrator at the site then conducted the study procedure of administering either the IP or the sham to the right eye of the participant on 24Nov2023 (Day 4).

On 08 Dec 2023, this issue was identified during a query discussion with SC when the Site Manager compared the eligibility confirmation form against the electronic data capture system.  On 11DEC 2023, it was also noted during a clinical review meeting that the study eye (right eye) for subject was deemed not eligible by BIRC and a query was opened.  The Principal Investigator was informed about this event on 11Dec2023 and confirmed that he thought that the study eye was the left eye, as was clearly documented in the subject’s source document.  As of  11 Dec 2023, the subject had not experienced any adverse events after the study procedure of administration of IP or sham.  The study team was made aware of this issue on 12Dec2023.  

There are no other known site compliance risks at this site.  There is no indication of risk to participant safety as GA is a bilateral disease.  In this case, the right eye is also affected by Geographic Atrophy (GA); however, the lesion size was smaller than the protocol allows. In this participant, so GA is potentially at an earlier stage in the right eye.

Misconduct-related issues (backdating) were previously identified/reported by the Janssen Site Manager based on a monitoring visit conducted 18-22 Mar 2021 (reported on 09-Apr-2021) as well as in subsequent monitoring visits. 
Up until Mar2021, only routine monitoring issues were noted in relation to source documents/data. When the current SM started on-site monitoring visits following the COVID-19 pandemic in Jan2021, he identified potential issues which were confirmed as back dating in Mar2021.

Subsequent monitoring visits in 2020 had to be conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Those issues were reported to Janssen BRQC QA on July 2021 and a for-cause GCP Clinical Site audit was conducted on 30-Aug–01-Sep-2021. Due to the pandemic and the related travel restrictions, the audit was conducted in a hybrid fashion. 

This Critical Observation and associated escalation confirm the site misconduct and inadequate documentation practices with impact on data accuracy and integrity. 

Finding Details 
•	Systemic backdating practices were observed/ reported during the monitoring visits conducted by Janssen Global Clinical Operations and confirmed during this for-cause audit. 
o	Example: Subject 210389, Cycle 5 Day 1 (31Dec2019). Principal Investigator confirmed during the audit interview that he was out of the country on 31Dec2019, however, several laboratory reports (dated 09Dec2019, 10Dec2019, 12Dec2019, 13Dec2019, 30Dec2019 and 31Dec2019), CT scan and Bone scan reports dated 30Dec2019 were signed and dated by the Principal Investigator to confirm medical review on 31Dec2019 (i.e., the date when he was out of the country).

•	Multiple data changes were made to source documentation/data were not traceable with a robust audit trail (initials, explanation, date).  
o	Example: Subject 210140, Bone scan worksheet (Part 1, 26Sep2019), PI’s signature dates were amended from “11Oct2019” to “26Sep2019” and back to “11Oct2019” by the Principal Investigator on 23Aug2021 (2 years later) initialed without explanation. It was unclear why the above amendment was made since the bone scan report date was 26Sep2019.

•	Clinical data (bone scans assessment and Adverse events (AEs)) were entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the Study Coordinator with no or significantly delayed medical confirmation by the Principal Investigator.

•	During the audit, no source documentation/data were available to support the conduct of key study procedures and medical assessments. At this site, access (direct or supervised “over-the-shoulder”) to all source data/documents maintained in the EMR was not permitted by the investigator/institution. Therefore, the source document/data consisted with printouts from the EMR. No quality control could be performed (printouts vs EMR) to confirm completeness & accuracy of the data/documents used for monitoring/auditing purposes. 

•	Systemic data discrepancies between the electronic Case Report Form and source data and inconsistencies were noted within the different source documents generated/maintained by the Site.

An assessment of the extent of these issues at this site will need to be performed and action plans to address these observations will be required per the BRQC QA Audit Reporting requirements.

The criteria selected for escalation:
Inappropriate randomization of a subject into a clinical trial e.g. a subject that did not meet protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria was enrolled, resulting in potential/significant risk to subject's safety.

Brief/succinct summary of issue
This event is currently considered a potential Significant Quality Issue per TV-SOP-25014 as it represented an immediate risk to patient safety. 

- Patient 100097 at site ES10002 (PI: Norma Carmen Gutierrez) was dosed with 400 mg of the IP as a third step up dose, as indicated by protocol (this was the 2nd highest dosing cohort in the study). After dosing, the patient developed Grade 3 CRS with Grade 5 fever, and subsequently died due to multiple organ failure. CRS is a known event with bispecific antibody therapy, having been reported 33 times in this study with 3 prior Grade 3 events. The Grade 5 fever was initially judged to be unrelated to IP.
- During the follow-up investigation, the central team discovered that the patient did not meet multiple entry criteria for the study. Each deviation of entry criteria is considered a major protocol deviation (MPD).
The MPDs were related to the following:
- Last IT therapy was administered from 07 Apr 2022 to 19 Apr 2022 (day -15 to day -4). CNS disease and intrathecal therapy (IT) treatment information was not available in the eCRF during eligibility review. According to exclusion criteria 4.2 the patient cannot have prior therapy two weeks before the first administration of study drug. 
- Patient had platelets = 50 at pre-dose without bone marrow involvement of the disease. This was out of range per inclusion criteria 4b. 

Initial IND safety report submitted on 20 May 2022.  FDA sent an Information Request to Janssen on 27 May 2022, with a requirement to respond no later than 01 June 2022 (deadline extended to 03 June 2022).  Janssen response is in progress.

- Ad hoc SMT meeting occurred on 27 May 2022 to determine acceptability of the 400 mg dose as step up 3 (SU3).  During a regular SET meeting (#10, on 18 – 19 May 2022), a detailed narrative about the fatal case was presented along with all the safety information available for the other patients being treated in cohorts 11b (5/30/400; n=4) and 12a (5/30/200 or 400/800; n= 6). SET recommended that the dose regimens for cohorts 11b (5/30/400) and 12a (5/30/200 or 400/800) continue without modification.  SMT has decided to adopt the SET recommendation and continue without dose modification for ongoing cohorts.

On 07 Dec 2021 the Principal Investigator (PI), for Site AU10004 under the Cilta-cel 68284528MMY3002 study, informed the Site Manager that patient 10004006 did not want to have Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) samples taken at Day 28 or at the follow-up visits conducted every 6 months as these were not in scope of the consent provided by the patient. 

Following central team assessment on 10 Dec 2021, it was determined that there are potentially 49 BMA samples that were collected that were not included in the master ICF for the Australian sites. The master Informed Consent Form (ICF) stated that BMA and biopsy samples would be performed at screening and in the event there is a Complete Response (CR) to treatment. This conflicts with the protocol which requires BMA samples to be taken at the following timepoints:
• Screening
• At time of suspected CR or sCR (stringent Complete Response)
• At 6, 12, 18, and 24 months (+/- 21 days) from C1D1 (Cycle 1, Day 1) regardless of whether or not CR is achieved

This update provides additional context for the original escalation raised on 15 Sep 2023. The original major audit observation for VAC52416BAC3001 noted ICON was not able to explain their emergency unblinding process (i.e their process to unblind a patient if a Principal Investigator is not available to decide and ICON is contacted as their delegate) as a contributing component of how the study was not able to demonstrate readiness for inspection. Further investigation after receipt of ICON’s CAPA response determined ICON did not have a process to manage emergency unblinding for 6 blinded active treatment trials per the Task Ownership Matrix requirements.

ICON subsequently committed to an action plan to develop an emergency unblinding process, train all safety physicians and implement emergency unblinding coverage for all 6 active blinded treatment trials by 30 September 2023. ICON also confirmed there have been no emergency unblinding events as of 22 Sep 2023 in any of the 6 active trials.

Issue background and description:

On 14 Dec 2021, the Safety Reporting team within the Global Medical Organisation (GMO) were made aware of a decrease in submission volume of rivaroxaban cases to US FDA for the month of October 2021.  A Quality Issue (2058211) was opened on 15 Dec 2021 to investigate, with a query run from 01 Oct 2021 - 14 Dec 2021 identifying ~600 rivaroxaban cases that would meet 15-day expedited criteria to the FDA.  A fix was applied to the production environment on 15 Dec 2021 to ensure the distribution rule (DR) logic is linked as required, with monitoring in place to ensure submissions are being generated as expected.  On 16 Dec 2021, the escalation lead was notified of the QI. 

Preliminary cause has been attributed to a technical issue of unlinked DR logic. Serious solicited and serious spontaneous DRs are known to be impacted. The total number of impacted DRs and overall number of missed submissions is TBD. Aris Global (the Global Safety System vendor) are investigating and a team has been convened to determine the total number of missed submissions and identify root cause. Initial assessment indicates the case count is 967 and is believed to be isolated to cases submitted to the US FDA (pending confirmation).   Submission of late cases will be managed with a bolus plan for HA communication and submission of cases to the FDA.

There is no impact on patient safety as the cases are in the safety database and included in routine safety signal detection activities. However, impact on regulatory compliance will be significant based on the provisional number of missed submissions to FDA.

Further investigation concluded that indeed an incorrect ancillary supply was centrally provided and used to prepare BCG (Intravesical Bacillus Calmette Guérin) for treatment of 9 patients in 7 US sites in the control arm using BCG in this study.
Use of wrong ancillary supplies to reconstitute the BCG, could have a potential impact towards the product and furthermore to the patient. The manufacturer would expect that the viability or growth of the bacteria in the bladder could be impeded. The sodium chloride in itself does not pose any safety risk toward patients.

Critical Observation:

Summary

In follow-up to the escalation REACT # 2214804 issued 16-Dec-2022 and to support the sponsor’s oversight and diligence, a for-cause GCP Clinical Investigator Site audit was conducted on 14-15FEB2023 by Janssen BRQC QA at the site of Prof. Olah (Szeged, Hungary). 

Significant issues with informed consent forms were confirmed by the auditors during the audit as follows:
•	Falsification of Sub-Investigator (SI) signature and date was confirmed by the auditors on 12 out 24 participants’ informed consent forms reviewed
•	Informed consent forms were missing for two pre-screened participants, despite study procedures (sample collection/sharing with external parties) being conducted.
•	Suspicious signatures and dates by study participants was observed on 2 of 3 addendum informed consent forms.  As other Informed Consent versions have been signed by these participants, it is unlikely that the falsification has impact on the participants’ willingness to continue participation in the trial.

As a result of these deficiencies, the impacted informed consents cannot be considered valid.  Additional details related to this issue and others identified during the audit are included in the audit report.  

Background

Two studies were reviewed during this audit: 64091742PCR3001 (Double-blind Study of Niraparib in Combination with Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone Versus Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone for Treatment of Subjects with Metastatic Prostate Cancer) and 67652000PCR3002 (Double-blind Study of Niraparib in Combination with Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone Versus Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone for the Treatment of Participants with Deleterious Germline or Somatic Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR) Gene-Mutated Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC)). 

These studies are monitored internally and the issues with informed consent identified in the monitoring process for the Magnitude and Amplitude trials were confirmed during the audit. 

Proposed Action Plan

•	Ensure every effort is made to obtain confirmation from participants that can still be contacted that informed consent has been obtained.
•	Assess impact on data integrity and usability of data from this clinical site.
•	Sponsor to assess potential reporting of the clinical site to regulatory agencies/ethics committee for non-compliance.

Two of the three Critical Observations are repeat observations from the previous audits conducted at IQVIA (JUN2018 ESP2018Q22406 and FEB2020 ESP2020Q13534), highlighting the insufficient mitigation actions implemented.   

Below is a summary of the three Critical Observations:
•	Significant Monitoring and Site Management deficiencies related to Monitoring and Pharmacy visits not conducted, not conducted in a timely manner, and/or not reported in a timely manner per the approved monitoring plans for the studies included in the audit sample. 

•	Significant IQVIA Trial Master File (Wingspan) deficiencies related to the completeness and the contemporaneousness filing of essential document in the TMF. Quality control processes to ensure the quality of the TMF were also found deficient and not robust. This is a repeat Critical Audit Observation from both the 2018 and 2020 Audits.

•	Deficient issue management and escalation processes as evidenced by failure to create Quality Issues (QI), delays in creating and reporting the QIs and insufficient tracking and oversight of the QIs. This is a repeat Critical Audit Observation from the 2018 Audit. Consequently, these deficiencies also contributed to delays in Janssen awareness and delays in Janssen processing and escalating of these quality issues. In addition, the CAPA management at IQVIA was also found deficient with action plans not created to proactively remediate significant/systemic issues, untimely closure of CAPA, inadequate documentation of root causes, and unclear assessment of Effectiveness Checks. 

In addition, six Major Observations were identified and reported in the Audit Report.

The management of the related action plans, including the development of Corrections and Corrective/Preventative Actions to address the Observations in the audit report, will adhere to the BRQC QA audit reporting processes.

Reason for the delays include: Essential documents rolled out to PPD in parts, across a span of 4 months, due to halt of Protocol V7 and additional Informed Consent Form updates, sequential submission requirements, ICF review delays by PPD/Janssen due to number of ICFs/country and lockdown at sites/HAs due to Covid impending EC/HA standard review turn-around-time.

Compliance issues were identified during on-site monitoring visits (OSMVs) for the Apalutamide 56021927PCR3011 PROTEUS study in the Netherlands.  OSMVs were performed at sites M49-NL10001, M49-NL10003, M49-NL10004, and M49-NL10005. These are being investigated in Quality Investigation (QI 2143989) that was initiated on 18 Jul 2022.  As a result of findings detailed below, there are major concerns regarding the integrity of the data across all sites in the Netherlands, as there is potential for major impact to the submission data for 49 patients enrolled at these 4 sites.

As part of the investigation an on-site compliance monitoring visit (OSCMV) of site M49-NL10005 was conducted on 04-05 Aug 2022.  It was determined there have been compliance issues that were overlooked by the Site Manager, who was involved in monitoring these sites over the past 3 years. Issues with the following were identified from this visit:  
•	Incomplete filing of essential documents in vTMF and ISF
•	Training
•	Consenting

Two model retroviruses, MMV (Minute Mouse Virus) and XMuLV (Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus) are used The Safety Factor is determined from the minimum viral clearance capacity of the process and the maximum potential viral load per dose of the product. Per guidance, the Safety Factor is expected to be at least 6 log. The Viral Clearance studies are outsourced to BioReliance (Rockville, MD). 

On 30Jan23, the Project Manager for viral clearance studies at BioReliance, communicated that event #552442 was opened in their Quality Management System. Details of the event specify that:

""During the transition from manual to Automated clearance, the RNA control used for assays 305700M and 305701M  was not prepared correctly. The RNA control should have undergone additional preparation after reconstitution of the g block. 

Due to the incorrect preparation of the RNA control for the XMuLV target, all studies performed since the launch in March 2022 will need to be assessed for impact, and we are halting qPCR for XMuLV testing until the necessary corrective actions have been put in place. The team is working to identify the impacted studies as quickly as possible, and I will provide a comprehensive list as soon as it is available.""

The described error was caused by omission of the transcription step prior to performance of the qPCR assays 305700M and 305701M for XMuLV (Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus). This means that double stranded DNA (dsDNA) material was used as template in the qPCR instead of single stranded RNA (ssRNA).

The issue impacts qualification and viral clearance studies with XMuLV performed between 24Mar22 and 25Jan23 at BioReliance.

List of impacted studies per product is attached to this record.

JNJ-79635322 is the only product where data generated in one of the impacted studies was included in clinical filings:

- Issue impacted XMuLV Viral Clearance data for the MabSelect SuRe LX Protein A Chromatography process step, which contributes 1.6 log to the total Safety Factor of >7.2 currently filed for a maximum dose of 400 mg.
- If this data would be omitted altogether (worst case), Safety Factor would drop to >5.6, which is still considered acceptable.
- There is an alternative option available to replace the currently filed modular Viral Clearance claim for the Low pH process step with actual data, which would bring the Safety Factor to >6.7. However, that means dropping the modular claim for this step, which impacts API strategy.

JNJ-63733657 did not include any impacted data in clinical filing:
 
- Issue impacted XMuLV Viral Clearance data for the Protein A Chromatography process step of the new DS high concentration formulation which is scheduled to be used in Part 2 of an Exploratory BA Study starting in Jun2023.
- CMC team decided to remove Protein A data from the IMPD amendment for DS high concentration (which was approved early February 2023 by Janssen). 
- Removing this data brings the Safety Factor to >5.4.
- Justification for considering this acceptable:
1) Three orthogonal process steps remain that have robust viral clearance capability,
2) These 3 steps showed complete clearance of virus, which means Safety Factor claim is conservative,
3) Several Janssen products have been successfully filed for clinic with Safety Factors below 6 log,

Background:
 Quality Issues
•	Multiple updates were made by the same Rater to source and electronic Data Capture (eDC) entries since the start of the study. This made it difficult to assess the correct subject information., as no clarification is provided in the source for these updates. Despite training and qualification, this Rater still made multiple, unexplained updates to source and eDC data
•	For 10 subjects who were screen failures, there was no available informed consent form at the site (QI1)
•	English version of MMSE was used and translated ad hoc for 3 Spanish speaking patients and the English MMSE where the data was first captured was destroyed

On 15 Dec 2022 the clinical team had agreed because of GCP and data issues at the site, to exclude data from the site in the final study analysis 
On 03Jan2023 during Janssen’s internal remote review of subject’s data a few discrepancies were noted in source documentation (scales form) and the subject eligibility assessment documentation.
On 19Jan2023, the CRA performed an interim onsite monitoring visit which included review of the potential discrepancies identified by the Janssen team. The CRA confirmed multiple scales deficiencies (SCIS-CT and MMSE scales), and numerous updates to source data without documented explanation by the Rater. Also, data in eDC has been updated by the Rater to match source data without explanation
On 14 Mar 2023 a clinical team meeting was held where a decision was made to close the site and a decision was made to escalate the issue as a potential SQI.

This was to reinforce the need of blood sample’s collection at screening by the sites (when applicable), in alignment with the previous and effective protocol versions V4.1 (17Jul2020) and V4 (13Mar2018): Exclusion Criterion #16 states that patients with “Known severe hepatic impairment, I.e., Child-Pugh Class C [see Appendix 1]” are to be to be excluded from the study.

Issue Background and Description:
On 12Aug2021, after receiving an email with SAE for JNJ-64407564 mentioning the protocol number TALMMY1001-PT3, it was identified by the Local Safety Specialist in Poland that 25 SUSARs from study 64407564MMY1001 for a single product (JNJ-64407564) were not submitted to the Poland  Health Authority (HA). These 25 cases appeared in Global Outbound Reporting System (GORS) with protocol number TALMMY1001-PT3. After discussions with Global Clinical Operations (GCO), it was concluded that TALMMY1001-PT3 is the identifier (ID) used for the ph2 portion (part 3) of study 64407564MMY1001. SUSARs that appeared in GORS with protocol number 64407564MMY1001 were submitted by Poland  Local Safety Unit (LSU) to HA. LSU was not aware of existence of the part3 study ID and assumed it related to a different Clinical Trial not approved in Poland, and therefore the cases with the TALMMY1001-PT3 protocol number were not submitted to Poland HA. The 25 cases include 19 individual cases and 6 updated versions with zero cases having country of occurrence as Poland.

The site confirmed that their process did not include checking the infusion container to confirm the infusion container was emptied, verifying that patients received their full dose of IP/Placebo per Janssen's IPPI instructions. 

Background: 
As specified in Investigational Product Preparation and Administration Instructions for Intravenous Administration for Nipocalimab and Placebo in 80202135IIM2001 (IPPI), when the IP/Placebo infusion container has emptied completely, flush the entire administration line to ensure that no IP/Placebo remains in the drip chamber and that all IP/Placebo solution is administered. The study team was informed this step was not completed on 09-Jun-2023. The study team was also informed the site IP/Placebo preparer did not fill the infusion tubing with IP/Placebo as instructed in the IPPI and instead used solution not containing IP/Placebo. 

Both noncompliant IP issues have occurred since the first patient was dosed in September 2022 and for all 3 patients. Per the protocol, patients are dosed with IP/Placebo every 2 weeks from Week 0 through Week 50.

Per ICON’s process, this noncompliance will be added to their ongoing Quality Issue (QE-099013) initiated for the unlicensed and non-trained site personnel completing IP/Placebo preparation (unblinded task) and administration (blinded task), reference Janssen Escalation #2262470 issued on 19-May-2023. 

Additional Details:  On 05-Jun-2023, the PI informed via email to ICON’s Global Operation Head and Janssen’s GPL stating the site was having an infusion issue. Janssen’s GPL requested ICON to further investigate this issue. A meeting was scheduled on 09-Jun-2023 with the PI, site staff, ICON team and Janssen team. The site was asked to explain their process of preparing and administration of IP/Placebo; where it was determined potential under dosing had been occurring since the first patient was dosed in September 2022 because the site never checked to make sure the infusion container was completely emptied after each IP administration. 

Actions Taken:
• On 13-Jun-2023, the decision was made between ICON and Janssen team to prematurely close the site due to patient safety concerns.
• On 13-Jun-2023, a decision was made to have Janssen and ICON investigate if under dosing is occurring globally (4 other opened sites) and not just at the impacted site. ICON will be responsible to document the outcome of this investigation per their process.

Critical Observation:  Failure to detect and report non-compliance as part of the site monitoring activities performed by ICON at the site of Dr. Huan, Yang (CN18601) in China, supporting the Nipocalimab MOM-M281-011 study. This study is monitored by ICON/PRA.

This Critical Observation and associated escalation is focused on study monitoring deficiencies (identification, follow-up, action to drive compliance) related to the non-compliances documented in other Major Observations (6) identified during the audit.

Finding Details 
 
During the audit, the monitoring activities did not identify and/or report the following significant non-compliances: 

•	Investigational Product incorrect dose (underdose) for 1 patient 
•	Source documentation ALCOA deficiencies regarding safety data and lack of documented evidence of the clinical interpretation of safety results from lab data
•	Insufficient training of the clinical site staff and study personnel
•	Protocol deviations not adequately reported in the monitoring reports and/or the Clinical Trial Management System (PSO)
•	ICH Essential Documents filing issues

Also, Monitoring visits were not conducted within the timeframes defined by the Clinical Management Plans (CMP): At the time of the audit, no unblinded monitoring visit (on-site or off-site/ remote) has been conducted. 
The first subject was enrolled on 30JUN2022. Per the CMP, the initial visit should be conducted within 10 (+5) business days of the first patient randomization visit if onsite visit was not allowed on the day of randomization. 

Per the CMP, to mitigate the limitations to access the site pharmacy during the Covid-19 pandemic, unblinded off-site/remote visits should be conducted. However, no remote visit was conducted as the site did not allow remote source document verification/review (SDV/SDR). The unblinded CRA reported monthly contacts with the site in the PSO system with no details on the IP-related discussions.

During the inspection, The original ICF(Informed consent form) of the three subjects were not located.
Relevant subjects: YSH-001, YSH-008, YSH025. All relevant subjects were screening failed.

For subjects YSH-001 and YSH-008, the ICFs were signed on 26May2016 and 09Nov2016, respectively, and SM had confirmed that the electronic copy of ICFs were uploaded on EMR (Electronic Medical Record) during the regular monitoring visits during that time. Later, the issue concerning the missing original copies of ICFs was found at the onsite monitoring visit on 26Mar2021, and reported to the IRB (Institutional Review Board) on 20May2021.

For subject YSH-025, any copy of ICF is not available, and there is no scanned copy uploaded to EMR, but the informed consent process was recorded on EMR on 04Sep2017 and it could be checked through the EMR audit trail. Also, the ICF was reviewed by the SM and it was documented on the MVR (monitoring report) dated 11 Sep2017. Later, the issue concerning the missing original copies of ICF was found at the onsite monitoring visit on 03 Feb 2020 and reported to the IRB on 06 Apr 2020.

Janssen did not distribute this AER as a SUSAR because the internal Janssen IB had been updated with the relevant safety information and Janssen considered the AER expected.  The EU IB Reference Safety Information (RSI) section needs to be submitted and approved by EMEA, which can lead to a later approval date then the internally approved IB.

The issue identified by the clinical team for study 28431754HFA3002 led to investigation of the safety reporting to investigators and IECs in general, covering all products serviced through the eSUSAR safety reporting system: 279 SUSARs were not distributed to EU/UK investigators/ECs as SUSARs between 17-JUN-2019 (applicable date for EU IB field implementation in GSS) and 10-MAY-2021.

This issue represents a regulatory compliance risk of under/late reporting of individual SUSAR notifications and adherence to the EU/UK RSI process in general. 
It means that investigators and IECs in relevant countries did not always have access to the latest EU IB SUSARs in real time. The impact may be partially mitigated by the fact that the SUSAR Line Listings, provided by Regulatory Medical Writing and made available every 6 months, do include SUSARs assessed against the EU IB, so even if a country requires SUSAR notifications, information was received through the SUSAR Line Listing as well.  (The evaluation to confirm that all SUSARs in scope were included in line listings has not yet concluded, expected to be completed 02-Sept-2021.)

Issue background and description:

On March 3, 2021, Janssen Vaccine and Prevention BV, Global Regulatory affairs communicated to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that they were submitting six (6) initial IND safety reports. The communication further advises the FDA that these cases are late and refers to a previously submitted late safety report.  This was in breach of FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.32), which require SUSARs from all sources to be assessed for reporting to the IND (Investigational New Drug) when the product is not marketed in USA.

The six cases referenced in the FDA correspondence were found as a result of a retrospective review of all reportable safety reports for the Ebola program that was undertaken after the discovery of the first late submission.  In November 2020, following a Safety Management Team (SMT) meeting, it was identified that febrile seizure cases were confirmed as attributable to the Ebola Vaccination Program VAC52150EBL4002 (Rwandan mass vaccination campaign), had not been reported as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) under the IND to the FDA.

A review of the IND safety reporting process, determined that the distribution rules (DRs) configured within the Janssen Global Safety Database (ArisG) excluded non-company sponsored trials and non-interventional program from reporting of SUSARs to the IND.

In January 2021, it was found that this also impacted VAC52150EBL3008; an interventional study sponsored by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

On 1 March 2021, DRs were implemented in ArisG to include all study and sponsor types.

-	Formal notification to Kenyan HA (to be submitted)
-	Non-compliance with requirements to submit SUSAR line listings, solicitated cases from Patient Support Programmes (PSPs) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs)

Issue background and description:
Following the departure of the Kenyan Local Safety Officer (LSO) in Q2 2021, routine LSO handover activities identified three quality issues relating to gaps in the local Pharmacovigilance system. Ranging back to 2018, these include:
- missed reporting of six monthly SUSAR line listings (1989387)
- 19 solicited Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from PSPs not reported to the Kenyan HA, (which have now been reported) (1976274)
- missed and late (Pharma and Consumer product) Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to the Kenyan HA.(1981857)

Preliminary review identified that a total of 8 SUSAR line listings (out of 14) were not submitted to Kenyan HA for the HIV VAC89220HPX2003 clinical trial. From 2018 to date, 14 PSURs (26%) were not submitted, 11 were submitted late (21%), and 3 (6%) submitted with a wrong date documented in the regulatory system (Insight). There is no risk to patient safety or to the benefit risk profile of the products. Further review is ongoing to ensure no other PV system gaps exist. This is expected to conclude mid-Aug.

The following deficiencies were identified regarding GCP compliance of patient record documentation (source data documentation) recorded in the clinical site electronic health record system (ALBIS):

Lack of audit trail, non-compliance with ALCOA principles 
1. The electronic patient record, which was initially defined as a medium for recording source data, is not technically suitable for ensuring the traceability of entries: An audit trail is not available. Changed entries are provided with a current time stamp, but the nature of the change is not apparent. Furthermore, it is possible to delete entries completely. A log file generated by the system, which stores accesses to records, is overwritten by the system on a quarterly basis. The integrity of the data stored in the electronic file was thus negatively affected in that any modifications and deletions are not clearly represented. This is particularly relevant for data that was subsequently printed after the facts described in deficiency D2 became known.

Inadequate or missing verification of the suitability of the conditions and processes at the study site with regard to the source data documentation.
2.	The information provided by the study site to the sponsor regarding the technical conditions (survey using the Electronic Source Data Compliance Assessment Questionnaire) was repeatedly incorrect, even after the conditions described in item 1 and in deficiency D2 became known.

The participants were dosed before the updated Protocol Amendment (including new safety info) was approved by the Ethics Committee. 


No adverse event or serious adverse events were reported to date for any of the 3 cases. The Medical Monitor did not see any safety concerns retrospectively.

The issue is isolated to the three sites associated with VAC31518COV3001 study. No similar issues with VAC31518COV3009 (ENSEMBLE2) study were identified. 

Root Cause
For VAC31518COV3001, the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system does not assign medication kit numbers to any participants. The unblinded site staff did not record the medication number in the system before administration as required and therefore they did not get any alerts indicating that vaccination was paused.

Site-specific root causes:
1.	Once the FDA lifted the vaccination pause for the public, the participant requested to get the vaccine, and the PI wanted to ensure that the participant was vaccinated.
2.	Miscommunication among the blinded and unblinded team and unclear understanding by the site of the study pause requirement. All site staff members did not receive the blast email communication announcing the vaccination pause.
3.	Unclear understanding by the site of the study pause requirement.",Closed,Janssen Pharmaceutical,Pharma - R&D,2021-07-22 09:43:28.000,"PROVENZANO-GRAY, JAMIE","•	Retraining of site staff on correct processes for IP dispensing / month 6 visit recording in IRT before IP dispensing, protocol adherence and implementation after IRB approval

This Critical Observation and associated escalation are focused on study monitoring deficiencies (extent, issue identification, corrective action to drive compliance) related to the non-compliances documented in other Major Observations identified during the audit. 
The VAC31518COV3009 ENSEMBLE 2 study is monitored by IQVIA per the Clinical Operations Plan (COP) V4 08MAR2021, and previous versions).

Finding Details 
IQVIA Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) did not comply with the Clinical Operation Plan (COP) for routine monitoring of trial conduct concerning the extent and timing of monitoring activities. In addition, non-compliances were not detected and reported in a timely manner. Also, the clinical site shared significant concerns regarding the monitoring activities and the support provided by IQVIA.

1° Untimely conduct of Monitoring Visits
Insufficient site management and site visit planning at study start causing Source Data Review (SDR) backlogs and site issue escalation delays. For example:
•	The Unblinded CRA did not complete the first Unblinded Pharmacy Monitoring Visit (PMV) within seven business days of first participant randomization.  The first participants were randomized on 16Nov2020, and the first PMV was conducted on 16Dec2020-17Dec2020 (22 business days later). At the time of the visit, the site had randomized 230 participants. One Unblinded CRA performed the PMV and only completed a review of 50 participants.
•	The Unblinded CRA did not complete the second PMV within two weeks (+/-7 days) after the first PMV. The second PMV was performed four weeks and five days later (19Jan2021). At the time of the visit, the site randomized 444 participants. One Unblinded CRA performed the PMV and completed a review of 250 participants. 
•	The Blinded CRA did not complete the first Onsite Monitoring Visit (OMV) when the first participant was randomized. The first participant was randomized on 16Nov2020, and the first OMV was 7Dec2020 (21 days later). At the time of the visit, the site had randomized 87 participants. One Blinded CRA performed the OMV and did not complete SDR.

2° Failure to detect and/or report non-compliances
No documented evidence was found to confirm that the monitoring activities identified protocol non-compliances, source document issues, and untimely filing of essential documents.  Non-compliances (as summarized in other observations) included: 
•	Systematic deviations from or changes to protocol-required study tests/procedures 
•	Inadequate site staff training and training reconciliation review 
•	ICH Essential Documents filing issues
•	Inadequate processing of SAE related records (no medical review & untimely reporting) 

3° Inappropriate Site Management 
Per the COP, the COP purpose is “To facilitate the exchange and documentation of relevant information and expectations between IQVIA and the Sponsor, and where appropriate, the Investigator”
During the audit, the Principal Investigator and the Site Director (SD) shared significant concerns regarding the monitoring activities and the support provided by IQVIA. The PI presented several site emails sent to the IQVIA study team with delays in providing support & responses.  
Those emails were related to the shortage of Covance lab kits/ancillary supplies and the implementation of the unblinding process per Protocol Amendment 4.

For reference, as part of the study VAC31518COV3001 study, similar significant issues were identified & escalated per TV-SOP-25014: Escalation of Significant Quality and Regulatory Compliance Issues.  These issues and their corresponding action have been captured in detail as follows:

Based on the medical/safety assessment by the team it was concluded that this has potential impact to patient safety.  

Background:
As specified in the study protocol, the unblinded pharmacist calculates the blinded nipocalimab dose (15 mg/kg) to provide accurate dosing to study participants. The Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) system dispenses the number of vials of study medication needed for a 15 mg/kg dose to the pharmacist. The study team was recently informed that the dose specified in the IWRS system was incorrectly specified, and the system was dispensing the number of vials needed for a 5 mg/kg dose rather than the 15 mg/kg dose specified in the protocol. 

To date, there is at least one randomized participant who has received at least one under dose of nipocalimab. To maintain study blinding, the Sponsor is unable to confirm whether additional patients have also received lesser doses of investigational product.

Immediate actions:

30Mar23 the Sr. IDMM notified BRQC, SRP and Sponsor study team of the subject under dosing and RTSM system error in a blinded manner. ICON unblinded CTM was also made aware and reported that issues were escalated to the CRO team.   On the same day during the SMT meeting it was confirmed that the urgent Safety Measure (USM) will be needed. 

31Mar23 the Sr. IDMM and GPL started to work with Randomization & Trial Supply Management (RTSM) team to verify the error and once verified, requested the error to be fixed urgently with Almac targeted for 7Apr23.

As of 07Sep23, an additional key study team member, the Statistical Programmer was also exposed to the unblinding data and will be removed from the trial as well, representing a potential significant impact on trial conduct. 

The study is outsourced to Icon and they will remove the team members that had access to LSAF (Life science analytics framework) system, where the unblinding data was found.  
Due to the nature of CDP trial (rare disease: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy) and considering that some sites could potentially include 1 patient only, the study team decided to remove the study members that were exposed to unblinding data. The unblinding impacted 4 subjects: 1 in China, 2 in US and 1 in Japan.

The impact assessment per Janssen Study Statistician is low (data integrity). There is no impact to patient safety. 

Additional Details:  
Overview of the root cause: The Drug Preparation in RAVE (eCRF) did not have the Data Extraction role view restricted. Unchecking the Data Extraction role from the View Restrictions for the Drug Preparation form in RAVE, by Icon DM, due to a misunderstanding in the eCRF Design Checklist, is what led to the unblinding of the Drug Preparation data.

One of the corrective actions as part of the original Janssen QI 2286297, was to remove all unblinding data from LSAF. However, on 07Sep23, it was discovered that the unblinded data was accidentally not removed from the 2 locations in LSAF. A double review of the LSAF dataset took place on 13Sep23 and, 2 additional locations in LSAF contained the unblinding data which was deleted.
